## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Fluentd](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/fluentd) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

> Note: Please, note that the forwarder runs the container as root by default setting the `forwarder.securityContext.runAsUser` to `0` (_root_ user)

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/fluentd
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

These commands deploy Fluentd on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcesPreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Forwarding the logs to another service

By default, the aggregators in this chart will send the processed logs to the standard output. However, a common practice is to send them to another service, like Elasticsearch, instead. This can be achieved with this Helm Chart by mounting your own configuration files. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-output
data:
  fluentd.conf: |
    # Prometheus Exporter Plugin
    # input plugin that exports metrics
    <source>
      @type prometheus
      port 24231
    </source>

    # input plugin that collects metrics from MonitorAgent
    <source>
      @type prometheus_monitor
      <labels>
        host ${hostname}
      </labels>
    </source>

    # input plugin that collects metrics for output plugin
    <source>
      @type prometheus_output_monitor
      <labels>
        host ${hostname}
      </labels>
    </source>

    # Ignore fluentd own events
    <match fluent.**>
      @type null
    </match>

    # TCP input to receive logs from the forwarders
    <source>
      @type forward
      bind 0.0.0.0
      port 24224
    </source>

    # HTTP input for the liveness and readiness probes
    <source>
      @type http
      bind 0.0.0.0
      port 9880
    </source>

    # Throw the healthcheck to the standard output instead of forwarding it
    <match fluentd.healthcheck>
      @type stdout
    </match>

    # Send the logs to the standard output
    <match **>
      @type elasticsearch
      include_tag_key true
      host "#{ENV['ELASTICSEARCH_HOST']}"
      port "#{ENV['ELASTICSEARCH_PORT']}"
      logstash_format true

      <buffer>
        @type file
        path /opt/bitnami/fluentd/logs/buffers/logs.buffer
        flush_thread_count 2
        flush_interval 5s
      </buffer>
    </match>
```

As an example, using the above configmap, you should specify the required parameters when upgrading or installing the chart:

```console
aggregator.configMap=elasticsearch-output
aggregator.extraEnvVars[0].name=ELASTICSEARCH_HOST
aggregator.extraEnvVars[0].value=your-ip-here
aggregator.extraEnvVars[1].name=ELASTICSEARCH_PORT
aggregator.extraEnvVars[1].value=your-port-here
```

### Prometheus metrics

This chart can be integrated with Prometheus by setting `metrics.enabled` to `true`. This will expose Fluentd native Prometheus endpoint in a metrics service that can be configured under the `metrics.service` section. It will have the necessary annotations to be automatically scraped by Prometheus.

#### Prometheus requirements

It is necessary to have a working installation of Prometheus or Prometheus Operator for the integration to work. Install the [Bitnami Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/prometheus) or the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) to easily have a working Prometheus in your cluster.

#### Integration with Prometheus Operator

The chart can deploy `ServiceMonitor` objects for integration with Prometheus Operator installations. To do so, set the value `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true`. Ensure that the Prometheus Operator `CustomResourceDefinitions` are installed in the cluster or it will fail with the following error:

```text
no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
```

Install the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) for having the necessary CRDs and the Prometheus Operator.

### Backup and restore

To back up and restore Helm chart deployments on Kubernetes, you need to back up the persistent volumes from the source deployment and attach them to a new deployment using [Velero](https://velero.io/), a Kubernetes backup/restore tool. Find the instructions for using Velero in [this guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-backup-restore-deployments-velero-index.html).

### Using custom init scripts

For advanced operations, the Bitnami Fluentd charts allows using custom init scripts that will be mounted inside `/docker-entrypoint.init-db`. You can include the file directly in your `values.yaml`, depending on where you are going to initialize your scripts with `aggregator.initScripts` (or `forwarder.initScripts`), or use a ConfigMap or a Secret (in case of sensitive data) for mounting these extra scripts. In this case you use the `aggregator.initScriptsCM` and `aggregator.initScriptsSecret` values (the same for `forwarder`).

```console
initScriptsCM=special-scripts
initScriptsSecret=special-scripts-sensitive
```

### Forwarder Security Context & Policy

By default, the **forwarder** `DaemonSet` from this chart **runs as the `root` user**, within the `root` group, assigning `root` file system permissions. This is different to the default behaviour of most Bitnami Helm charts where we [prefer to work with non-root containers](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html).

The default behaviour is to run as `root` because:

- the forwarder needs to mount `hostPath` volumes from the underlying node to read Docker container (& potentially other) logs
- in many Kubernetes node distributions, these log files are not readable by anyone other than `root`
- `fsGroup` doesn't work with `hostPath` volumes to allow the process to run non-root with alternate file system permissions

Since we would like the chart to work out-of-the-box for as many users as possible, the `forwarder` thus runs as root by default. You can read more about the motivation for this at [#1905](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/1905) and [#2323](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/pull/2323), however you should be aware of this, and the risks of running root containers in general.

If you enable the forwarder's [bundled PodSecurityPolicy](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/fluentd/templates/forwarder-psp.yaml) with `forwarder.rbac.pspEnabled=true` it will allow the pod to run as `root` by default, while ensuring as many other privileges as possible are dropped.

#### Running as non-root

You can run as the `fluentd` user/group (non-root) with the below overrides if:

- you have control of the `hostPath` filesystem permissions on your nodes sufficient to allow the fluentd user to read from them
- don't need to write to the `hostPath`s

Note that if you have enabled the [bundled PodSecurityPolicy](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/fluentd/templates/forwarder-psp.yaml), it will adapt to the Chart values overrides.

```yaml
forwarder:
  daemonUser: fluentd
  daemonGroup: fluentd

  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1001
    runAsGroup: 1001
    fsGroup: 1001
```

#### Pod Security Policy & Custom `hostPath`s

Mounting additional `hostPath`s is sometimes required to deal with `/var/lib` being symlinked on some Kubernetes environments. If you need to do so, the [bundled PodSecurityPolicy](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/fluentd/templates/forwarder-psp.yaml) will likely not meet your needs, as it whitelists only the standard `hostPath`s.

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `XXX.affinity` parameter(s). Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `XXX.podAffinityPreset`, `XXX.podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `XXX.nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

### Securing traffic using TLS

TLS for the Fluentd can be enabled by setting `tls.enabled=true`. The chart allows two configuration options:

- Provide your own secrets for the forwarder and aggregator using the `tls.aggregator.existingSecret` and `tls.forwarder.existingSecret` values.
- Have the chart auto-generate the certificates using `tls.autoGenerated=true`.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set aggregator.port=24444 oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/fluentd
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The above command sets the aggregators to listen on port 24444.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/fluentd
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/fluentd/values.yaml)

## Upgrading

### To 7.1.0

This version introduces image verification for security purposes. To disable it, set `global.security.allowInsecureImages` to `true`. More details at [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/30850).

### To 7.0.0

Starting version 7.0.0, using different images for aggregator and forwarder is no longer supported.
The values `aggregator.image` and `forwarder.image` have been removed.

### To 6.0.0

This major bump changes the following security defaults:

- `runAsGroup` is changed from `0` to `1001`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is set to `true`
- `resourcesPreset` is changed from `none` to the minimum size working in our test suites (NOTE: `resourcesPreset` is not meant for production usage, but `resources` adapted to your use case).
- `global.compatibility.openshift.adaptSecurityContext` is changed from `disabled` to `auto`.

This could potentially break any customization or init scripts used in your deployment. If this is the case, change the default values to the previous ones.

### To 5.0.0

This major release renames several values in this chart and adds missing features, in order to be inline with the rest of assets in the Bitnami charts repository.

Affected values:

- `aggregator.persistence.accessMode` has been renamed as `aggregator.persistence.accessModes` with type Array.
- `aggregator.lifecycle` and `forwarder.lifecycle` have been renamed as `aggregator.lifecycleHooks` and `forwarder.lifecycleHooks` respectively.
- `aggregator.extraEnv` and `forwarder.extraEnv` have been renamed as `aggregator.extraEnvVars` and `forwarder.extraEnvVars` respectively.
- `aggregator.securityContext` and `forwarder.securityContext` have been renamed as `aggregator.podSecurityContext` and `forwarder.podSecurityContext` respectively.
- `rbac.*` and `serviceAccount.*` have been definitely removed. Deprecation warning will no longer show.

Additionally also updates the Redis&reg; subchart to it newest major, 14.0.0, which contains similar changes.

### To 4.0.0

In this version, introduces changes to the `tls.*` settings.
The previous settings only would mount the TLS volume in the container, and have been removed as the Chart now includes `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` which could be used for that purpose.
The new `tls.*` settings will now configure SSL/TLS certificates for the out_forward communications in the Fluentd Forwarder and in_forward in the Fluentd Aggregator, securing the communications between the Forwarder and the Aggretator.

### To 3.1.0

This version also introduces `bitnami/common`, a [library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/#helm) as a dependency. More documentation about this new utility could be found [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#bitnami-common-library-chart). Please, make sure that you have updated the chart dependencies before executing any upgrade.

### To 3.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

#### What changes were introduced in this major version?

- Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
- The different fields present in the _Chart.yaml_ file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Charts

#### Considerations when upgrading to this version

- If you want to upgrade to this version from a previous one installed with Helm v3, you shouldn't face any issues
- If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm v2, this scenario is not supported as this version doesn't support Helm v2 anymore
- If you installed the previous version with Helm v2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm v3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm v2 to v3

### To 2.0.0

This version introduces the ability to create/customise a `ServiceAccount` to be used by the **aggregator**, making it possible to target the aggregator with [`PodSecurityPolicy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) independent of the **forwarder**'s `ServiceAccount`.

The **forwarder** previously used the below top-level values to configure its own `ServiceAccount`, which have been moved under the `forwarder.` prefix to avoid confusion, and only created if `forwarder.enabled=true`. There is no functional change as a result of this, and if you did not override the defaults for `serviceAccount` or `rbac`, this change does not require any action from you.

If you are overriding the default values from the `1.x` chart, the chart will fail installation with your old overrides and warn you of the necessary changes.

```yaml
# before - 1.x
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  name: my-custom-service-account
  annotations:
    my-custom-annotation: my-custom-annotation-value
rbac:
  create: true

# after - 2.x
forwarder:
  # ...
  serviceAccount:
    create: true
    name: my-custom-service-account
    annotations:
      my-custom-annotation: my-custom-annotation-value
  rbac:
    create: true
```

### To 1.0.0

In this version of the chart the Fluentd forwarder daemon system user will be root by default. This is done to ensure that mounted host paths are readable by the forwarder. For more context, check this [support case](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/1905).

No issues are expected in the upgrade process. However, please ensure that you add extra security measures in your cluster as you will be running root containers. If you want the daemon to be run as a user different from root, you can change the `forwarder.daemonUser` and `forwarder.daemonGroup` values. In this case make sure that the user you choose has sufficient permissions to read log files under `/var/lib/docker/containers` directory.
