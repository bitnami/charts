          JWTAuthenticator describes the configuration of a JWT authenticator.


          Upon receiving a signed JWT, a JWTAuthenticator will performs some validation on it (e.g., valid
          signature, existence of claims, etc.) and extract the username and groups from the token.

                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
