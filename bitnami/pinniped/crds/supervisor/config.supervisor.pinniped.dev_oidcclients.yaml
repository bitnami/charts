                    This scope must always be listed.
                  - offline_access: The client is allowed to request an initial refresh token during the authorization code grant flow.
                    This scope must be listed if allowedGrantTypes lists refresh_token.
                  - pinniped:request-audience: The client is allowed to request a new audience value during a RFC8693 token exchange,
                    which is a step in the process to be able to get a cluster credential for the user.
                    openid, username and groups scopes must be listed when this scope is present.
                    This scope must be listed if allowedGrantTypes lists urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange.

                    Without the username scope being requested and allowed, the ID token will not contain the user's username.
                  - groups: The client is allowed to request that ID tokens contain the user's group membership,
                    if their group membership is discoverable by the Supervisor.
                    Without the groups scope being requested and allowed, the ID token will not contain groups.

                      idTokenSeconds is the lifetime of ID tokens issued to this client, in seconds. This will choose the lifetime of
                      ID tokens returned by the authorization flow and the refresh grant. It will not influence the lifetime of the ID
                      tokens returned by RFC8693 token exchange. When null, a short-lived default value will be used.
                      This value must be between 120 and 1,800 seconds (30 minutes), inclusive. It is recommended to make these tokens
                      short-lived to force the client to perform the refresh grant often, because the refresh grant will check with the
                      external identity provider to decide if it is acceptable for the end user to continue their session, and will
                      update the end user's group memberships from the external identity provider. Giving these tokens a long life is
                      will allow the end user to continue to use a token while avoiding these updates from the external identity
                      provider. However, some web applications may have reasons specific to the design of that application to prefer
                      longer lifetimes.
