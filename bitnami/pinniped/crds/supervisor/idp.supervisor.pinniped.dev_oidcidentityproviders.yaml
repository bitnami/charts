                  additionalAuthorizeParameters:
                    description: |-
                      additionalAuthorizeParameters are extra query parameters that should be included in the authorize request to your
                      OIDC provider in the authorization request during an OIDC Authorization Code Flow. By default, no extra
                      parameters are sent. The standard parameters that will be sent are "response_type", "scope", "client_id",
                      "state", "nonce", "code_challenge", "code_challenge_method", and "redirect_uri". These parameters cannot be
                      included in this setting. Additionally, the "hd" parameter cannot be included in this setting at this time.
                      The "hd" parameter is used by Google's OIDC provider to provide a hint as to which "hosted domain" the user
                      should use during login. However, Pinniped does not yet support validating the hosted domain in the resulting
                      ID token, so it is not yet safe to use this feature of Google's OIDC provider with Pinniped.
                      This setting does not influence the parameters sent to the token endpoint in the Resource Owner Password
                      Credentials Grant. The Pinniped Supervisor requires that your OIDC provider returns refresh tokens to the
                      Supervisor from the authorization flows. Some OIDC providers may require a certain value for the "prompt"
                      parameter in order to properly request refresh tokens. See the documentation of your OIDC provider's
                      authorization endpoint for its requirements for what to include in the request in order to receive a refresh
                      token in the response, if anything. If your provider requires the prompt parameter to request a refresh token,
                      then include it here. Also note that most providers also require a certain scope to be requested in order to
                      receive refresh tokens. See the additionalScopes setting for more information about using scopes to request
                      refresh tokens.

                    description: |-
                      additionalScopes are the additional scopes that will be requested from your OIDC provider in the authorization
                      request during an OIDC Authorization Code Flow and in the token request during a Resource Owner Password Credentials
                      Grant. Note that the "openid" scope will always be requested regardless of the value in this setting, since it is
                      always required according to the OIDC spec. By default, when this field is not set, the Supervisor will request
                      the following scopes: "openid", "offline_access", "email", and "profile". See
                      https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims for a description of the "profile" and "email"
                      scopes. See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess for a description of the
                      "offline_access" scope. This default value may change in future versions of Pinniped as the standard evolves,
                      or as common patterns used by providers who implement the standard in the ecosystem evolve.
                      By setting this list to anything other than an empty list, you are overriding the
                      default value, so you may wish to include some of "offline_access", "email", and "profile" in your override list.
                      If you do not want any of these scopes to be requested, you may set this list to contain only "openid".
                      Some OIDC providers may also require a scope to get access to the user's group membership, in which case you
                      may wish to include it in this list. Sometimes the scope to request the user's group membership is called
                      "groups", but unfortunately this is not specified in the OIDC standard.
                      Generally speaking, you should include any scopes required to cause the appropriate claims to be the returned by
                      your OIDC provider in the ID token or userinfo endpoint results for those claims which you would like to use in
                      the oidcClaims settings to determine the usernames and group memberships of your Kubernetes users. See
                      your OIDC provider's documentation for more information about what scopes are available to request claims.
                      Additionally, the Pinniped Supervisor requires that your OIDC provider returns refresh tokens to the Supervisor
                      from these authorization flows. For most OIDC providers, the scope required to receive refresh tokens will be
                      "offline_access". See the documentation of your OIDC provider's authorization and token endpoints for its
                      requirements for what to include in the request in order to receive a refresh token in the response, if anything.
                      Note that it may be safe to send "offline_access" even to providers which do not require it, since the provider
                      may ignore scopes that it does not understand or require (see
                      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3). In the unusual case that you must avoid sending the
                      "offline_access" scope, then you must override the default value of this setting. This is required if your OIDC
                      provider will reject the request when it includes "offline_access" (e.g. GitLab's OIDC provider).

                    description: |-
                      allowPasswordGrant, when true, will allow the use of OAuth 2.0's Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
                      (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) to authenticate to the OIDC provider using a
                      username and password without a web browser, in addition to the usual browser-based OIDC Authorization Code Flow.
                      The Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant is not officially part of the OIDC specification, so it may not be
                      supported by your OIDC provider. If your OIDC provider supports returning ID tokens from a Resource Owner Password
                      Credentials Grant token request, then you can choose to set this field to true. This will allow end users to choose
                      to present their username and password to the kubectl CLI (using the Pinniped plugin) to authenticate to the
                      cluster, without using a web browser to log in as is customary in OIDC Authorization Code Flow. This may be
                      convenient for users, especially for identities from your OIDC provider which are not intended to represent a human
                      actor, such as service accounts performing actions in a CI/CD environment. Even if your OIDC provider supports it,
                      you may wish to disable this behavior by setting this field to false when you prefer to only allow users of this
                      OIDCIdentityProvider to log in via the browser-based OIDC Authorization Code Flow. Using the Resource Owner Password
                      Credentials Grant means that the Pinniped CLI and Pinniped Supervisor will directly handle your end users' passwords
                      (similar to LDAPIdentityProvider), and you will not be able to require multi-factor authentication or use the other
                      web-based login features of your OIDC provider during Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant logins.
                      allowPasswordGrant defaults to false.

                      "additionalClaims" claim of the ID tokens generated by the Supervisor. This should be specified as a map of
                      new claim names as the keys, and upstream claim names as the values. These new claim names will be nested
                      under the top-level "additionalClaims" claim in ID tokens generated by the Supervisor when this
                      OIDCIdentityProvider was used for user authentication. These claims will be made available to all clients.
                      This feature is not required to use the Supervisor to provide authentication for Kubernetes clusters, but can be
                      used when using the Supervisor for other authentication purposes. When this map is empty or the upstream claims
                      are not available, the "additionalClaims" claim will be excluded from the ID tokens generated by the Supervisor.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
