              identityProviders:
                description: |-
                  IdentityProviders is the list of identity providers available for use by this FederationDomain.


                  An identity provider CR (e.g. OIDCIdentityProvider or LDAPIdentityProvider) describes how to connect to a server,
                  how to talk in a specific protocol for authentication, and how to use the schema of that server/protocol to
                  extract a normalized user identity. Normalized user identities include a username and a list of group names.
                  In contrast, IdentityProviders describes how to use that normalized identity in those Kubernetes clusters which
                  belong to this FederationDomain. Each entry in IdentityProviders can be configured with arbitrary transformations
                  on that normalized identity. For example, a transformation can add a prefix to all usernames to help avoid
                  accidental conflicts when multiple identity providers have different users with the same username (e.g.
                  "idp1:ryan" versus "idp2:ryan"). Each entry in IdentityProviders can also implement arbitrary authentication
                  rejection policies. Even though a user was able to authenticate with the identity provider, a policy can disallow
                  the authentication to the Kubernetes clusters that belong to this FederationDomain. For example, a policy could
                  disallow the authentication unless the user belongs to a specific group in the identity provider.


                  For backwards compatibility with versions of Pinniped which predate support for multiple identity providers,
                  an empty IdentityProviders list will cause the FederationDomain to use all available identity providers which
                  exist in the same namespace, but also to reject all authentication requests when there is more than one identity
                  provider currently defined. In this backwards compatibility mode, the name of the identity provider resource
                  (e.g. the Name of an OIDCIdentityProvider resource) will be used as the name of the identity provider in this
                  FederationDomain. This mode is provided to make upgrading from older versions easier. However, instead of
                  relying on this backwards compatibility mode, please consider this mode to be deprecated and please instead
                  explicitly list the identity provider using this IdentityProviders field.

                            authentication attempt, including during every session refresh.
                            Each is a CEL expression. It may use the basic CEL language as defined in
                            https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md plus the CEL string extensions defined in
                            https://github.com/google/cel-go/tree/master/ext#strings.


                            The username and groups extracted from the identity provider, and the constants defined in this CR, are
                            available as variables in all expressions. The username is provided via a variable called `username` and
                            the list of group names is provided via a variable called `groups` (which may be an empty list).
                            Each user-provided constants is provided via a variable named `strConst.varName` for string constants
                            and `strListConst.varName` for string list constants.


                            The only allowed types for expressions are currently policy/v1, username/v1, and groups/v1.
                            Each policy/v1 must return a boolean, and when it returns false, no more expressions from the list are evaluated
                            and the authentication attempt is rejected.
                            Transformations of type policy/v1 do not return usernames or group names, and therefore cannot change the
                            username or group names.
                            Each username/v1 transform must return the new username (a string), which can be the same as the old username.
                            Transformations of type username/v1 do not return group names, and therefore cannot change the group names.
                            Each groups/v1 transform must return the new groups list (list of strings), which can be the same as the old
                            groups list.
                            Transformations of type groups/v1 do not return usernames, and therefore cannot change the usernames.
                            After each expression, the new (potentially changed) username or groups get passed to the following expression.


                            Any compilation or static type-checking failure of any expression will cause an error status on the FederationDomain.
                            During an authentication attempt, any unexpected runtime evaluation errors (e.g. division by zero) cause the
                            authentication attempt to fail. When all expressions evaluate successfully, then the (potentially changed) username
                            and group names have been decided for that authentication attempt.

                    description: |-
                      SecretName is an optional name of a Secret in the same namespace, of type `kubernetes.io/tls`, which contains
                      the TLS serving certificate for the HTTPS endpoints served by this FederationDomain. When provided, the TLS Secret
                      named here must contain keys named `tls.crt` and `tls.key` that contain the certificate and private key to use
                      for TLS.


                      Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) supported by all major browsers.


                      SecretName is required if you would like to use different TLS certificates for issuers of different hostnames.
                      SNI requests do not include port numbers, so all issuers with the same DNS hostname must use the same
                      SecretName value even if they have different port numbers.


                      SecretName is not required when you would like to use only the HTTP endpoints (e.g. when the HTTP listener is
                      configured to listen on loopback interfaces or UNIX domain sockets for traffic from a service mesh sidecar).
                      It is also not required when you would like all requests to this OIDC Provider's HTTPS endpoints to
                      use the default TLS certificate, which is configured elsewhere.


                      When your Issuer URL's host is an IP address, then this field is ignored. SNI does not work for IP addresses.
