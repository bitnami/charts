                      (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/rootdse).
                      The default behavior searches your entire domain for groups.
                      It may make sense to specify a subtree as a search base if you wish to exclude some groups

                      The pattern "{}" must occur in the filter at least once and will be dynamically replaced by the
                      value of an attribute of the user entry found as a result of the user search. Which attribute's
                      value is used to replace the placeholder(s) depends on the value of UserAttributeForFilter.
                      E.g. "member={}" or "&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(member={})".
                      For more information about ActiveDirectory filters, see https://ldap.com/ldap-filters.
                      Note that the dn (distinguished name) is not an attribute of an entry, so "dn={}" cannot be used.
                      Optional. When not specified, the default will act as if the filter were specified as
                      "(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={})".
                      This searches nested groups by default.
                      Note that nested group search can be slow for some Active Directory servers. To disable it,
                      you can set the filter to
                      "(&(objectClass=group)(member={})"

                  skipGroupRefresh:
                    description: |-
                      The user's group membership is refreshed as they interact with the supervisor
                      to obtain new credentials (as their old credentials expire).  This allows group
                      membership changes to be quickly reflected into Kubernetes clusters.  Since
                      group membership is often used to bind authorization policies, it is important
                      to keep the groups observed in Kubernetes clusters in-sync with the identity
                      provider.

                      In some environments, frequent group membership queries may result in a
                      significant performance impact on the identity provider and/or the supervisor.
                      The best approach to handle performance impacts is to tweak the group query
                      to be more performant, for example by disabling nested group search or by
                      using a more targeted group search base.

                      If the group search query cannot be made performant and you are willing to
                      have group memberships remain static for approximately a day, then set
                      skipGroupRefresh to true.  This is an insecure configuration as authorization
                      policies that are bound to group membership will not notice if a user has
                      been removed from a particular group until their next login.

                      This is an experimental feature that may be removed or significantly altered
                      in the future.  Consumers of this configuration should carefully read all
                      release notes before upgrading to ensure that the meaning of this field has
                      not changed.

                      the user search will be used to replace the "{}" placeholder(s) in the group search Filter.
                      For example, specifying "uid" as the UserAttributeForFilter while specifying
                      "&(objectClass=posixGroup)(memberUid={})" as the Filter would search for groups by replacing
                      the "{}" placeholder in the Filter with the value of the user's "uid" attribute.
                      Optional. When not specified, the default will act as if "dn" were specified. For example, leaving

                      would search for groups by replacing the "{}" placeholder(s) with the dn (distinguished name) of the user.
