                      The default behavior searches your entire domain for groups.
                      It may make sense to specify a subtree as a search base if you
                      wish to exclude some groups for security reasons or to make
                      searches faster.

                      be dynamically replaced by the dn (distinguished name) of the
                      user entry found as a result of the user search. E.g. "member={}"
                      or "&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(member={})". For more information
                      about ActiveDirectory filters, see https://ldap.com/ldap-filters.
                      Note that the dn (distinguished name) is not an attribute of
                      an entry, so "dn={}" cannot be used. Optional. When not specified,
                      the default will act as if the filter were specified as "(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={})".
                      This searches nested groups by default. Note that nested group
                      search can be slow for some Active Directory servers. To disable
                      it, you can set the filter to "(&(objectClass=group)(member={})"

                      old credentials expire).  This allows group membership changes
                      to be quickly reflected into Kubernetes clusters.  Since group
                      membership is often used to bind authorization policies, it
                      is important to keep the groups observed in Kubernetes clusters
                      in-sync with the identity provider. \n In some environments,
                      frequent group membership queries may result in a significant
                      performance impact on the identity provider and/or the supervisor.
                      The best approach to handle performance impacts is to tweak
                      the group query to be more performant, for example by disabling
                      nested group search or by using a more targeted group search
                      base. \n If the group search query cannot be made performant
                      and you are willing to have group memberships remain static
                      for approximately a day, then set skipGroupRefresh to true.
                      \ This is an insecure configuration as authorization policies
                      that are bound to group membership will not notice if a user
                      has been removed from a particular group until their next login.
                      \n This is an experimental feature that may be removed or significantly
                      altered in the future.  Consumers of this configuration should
                      carefully read all release notes before upgrading to ensure
                      that the meaning of this field has not changed."

                      For more information about LDAP filters, see https://ldap.com/ldap-filters.
                      Note that the dn (distinguished name) is not an attribute of

                      old credentials expire).  This allows group membership changes
                      to be quickly reflected into Kubernetes clusters.  Since group
                      membership is often used to bind authorization policies, it
                      is important to keep the groups observed in Kubernetes clusters
                      in-sync with the identity provider. \n In some environments,
                      frequent group membership queries may result in a significant
                      performance impact on the identity provider and/or the supervisor.
                      The best approach to handle performance impacts is to tweak
                      the group query to be more performant, for example by disabling
                      nested group search or by using a more targeted group search
                      base. \n If the group search query cannot be made performant
                      and you are willing to have group memberships remain static
                      for approximately a day, then set skipGroupRefresh to true.
                      \ This is an insecure configuration as authorization policies
                      that are bound to group membership will not notice if a user
                      has been removed from a particular group until their next login.
                      \n This is an experimental feature that may be removed or significantly
                      altered in the future.  Consumers of this configuration should
                      carefully read all release notes before upgrading to ensure
                      that the meaning of this field has not changed."

                      provider in the authorization request during an OIDC Authorization
                      Code Flow. By default, no extra parameters are sent. The standard
                      parameters that will be sent are "response_type", "scope", "client_id",
                      "state", "nonce", "code_challenge", "code_challenge_method",
                      and "redirect_uri". These parameters cannot be included in this
                      setting. Additionally, the "hd" parameter cannot be included
                      in this setting at this time. The "hd" parameter is used by
                      Google's OIDC provider to provide a hint as to which "hosted
                      domain" the user should use during login. However, Pinniped
                      does not yet support validating the hosted domain in the resulting
                      ID token, so it is not yet safe to use this feature of Google's
                      OIDC provider with Pinniped. This setting does not influence
                      the parameters sent to the token endpoint in the Resource Owner
                      Password Credentials Grant. The Pinniped Supervisor requires
                      that your OIDC provider returns refresh tokens to the Supervisor
                      from the authorization flows. Some OIDC providers may require
                      a certain value for the "prompt" parameter in order to properly
                      request refresh tokens. See the documentation of your OIDC provider's
                      authorization endpoint for its requirements for what to include
                      in the request in order to receive a refresh token in the response,
                      if anything. If your provider requires the prompt parameter
                      to request a refresh token, then include it here. Also note
                      that most providers also require a certain scope to be requested
                      in order to receive refresh tokens. See the additionalScopes
                      setting for more information about using scopes to request refresh
                      tokens.

                      request during a Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant.
                      Note that the "openid" scope will always be requested regardless
                      of the value in this setting, since it is always required according
                      to the OIDC spec. By default, when this field is not set, the
                      Supervisor will request the following scopes: "openid", "offline_access",
                      "email", and "profile". See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims
                      for a description of the "profile" and "email" scopes. See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess
                      for a description of the "offline_access" scope. This default
                      value may change in future versions of Pinniped as the standard
                      evolves, or as common patterns used by providers who implement
                      the standard in the ecosystem evolve. By setting this list to
                      anything other than an empty list, you are overriding the default
                      value, so you may wish to include some of "offline_access",
                      "email", and "profile" in your override list. If you do not
                      want any of these scopes to be requested, you may set this list
                      to contain only "openid". Some OIDC providers may also require
                      a scope to get access to the user''s group membership, in which
                      case you may wish to include it in this list. Sometimes the
                      scope to request the user''s group membership is called "groups",
                      but unfortunately this is not specified in the OIDC standard.
                      Generally speaking, you should include any scopes required to
                      cause the appropriate claims to be the returned by your OIDC
                      provider in the ID token or userinfo endpoint results for those
                      claims which you would like to use in the oidcClaims settings
                      to determine the usernames and group memberships of your Kubernetes
                      users. See your OIDC provider''s documentation for more information
                      about what scopes are available to request claims. Additionally,
                      the Pinniped Supervisor requires that your OIDC provider returns
                      refresh tokens to the Supervisor from these authorization flows.
                      For most OIDC providers, the scope required to receive refresh
                      tokens will be "offline_access". See the documentation of your
                      OIDC provider''s authorization and token endpoints for its requirements
                      for what to include in the request in order to receive a refresh
                      token in the response, if anything. Note that it may be safe
                      to send "offline_access" even to providers which do not require
                      it, since the provider may ignore scopes that it does not understand
                      or require (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3).
                      In the unusual case that you must avoid sending the "offline_access"
                      scope, then you must override the default value of this setting.
                      This is required if your OIDC provider will reject the request
                      when it includes "offline_access" (e.g. GitLab''s OIDC provider).'

                      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) to
                      authenticate to the OIDC provider using a username and password
                      without a web browser, in addition to the usual browser-based
                      OIDC Authorization Code Flow. The Resource Owner Password Credentials
                      Grant is not officially part of the OIDC specification, so it
                      may not be supported by your OIDC provider. If your OIDC provider
                      supports returning ID tokens from a Resource Owner Password
                      Credentials Grant token request, then you can choose to set
                      this field to true. This will allow end users to choose to present
                      their username and password to the kubectl CLI (using the Pinniped
                      plugin) to authenticate to the cluster, without using a web
                      browser to log in as is customary in OIDC Authorization Code
                      Flow. This may be convenient for users, especially for identities
                      from your OIDC provider which are not intended to represent
                      a human actor, such as service accounts performing actions in
                      a CI/CD environment. Even if your OIDC provider supports it,
                      you may wish to disable this behavior by setting this field
                      to false when you prefer to only allow users of this OIDCIdentityProvider
                      to log in via the browser-based OIDC Authorization Code Flow.
                      Using the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant means that
                      the Pinniped CLI and Pinniped Supervisor will directly handle
                      your end users' passwords (similar to LDAPIdentityProvider),
                      and you will not be able to require multi-factor authentication
                      or use the other web-based login features of your OIDC provider
                      during Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant logins. allowPasswordGrant
                      defaults to false.
