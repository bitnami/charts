Looking to use OpenSearch in production? Try [VMware Tanzu Application Catalog](https://bitnami.com/enterprise), the enterprise edition of Bitnami Application Catalog.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [OpenSearch](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/opensearch) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/opensearch
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

These commands deploy OpenSearch on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcePreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Change OpenSearch version

To modify the OpenSearch version used in this chart you can specify a [valid image tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/opensearch/tags/) using the `image.tag` parameter. For example, `image.tag=X.Y.Z`. This approach is also applicable to other images like exporters.

### Default kernel settings

Currently, OpenSearch requires some changes in the kernel of the host machine to work as expected. If those values are not set in the underlying operating system, the OS containers fail to boot with ERROR messages. More information about these requirements can be found in the links below:

- [File Descriptor requirements](https://www.open.co/guide/en/opensearch/reference/current/file-descriptors.html)
- [Virtual memory requirements](https://www.open.co/guide/en/opensearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html)

This chart uses a **privileged** initContainer to change those settings in the Kernel by running: `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144 && sysctl -w fs.file-max=65536`.
You can disable the initContainer using the `sysctlImage.enabled=false` parameter.

### Adding extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: OPENSEARCH_VERSION
    value: 7.0
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Using custom init scripts

For advanced operations, the Bitnami OpenSearch charts allows using custom init scripts that will be mounted inside `/docker-entrypoint.init-db`. You can include the file directly in your `values.yaml` with `initScripts`, or use a ConfigMap or a Secret (in case of sensitive data) for mounting these extra scripts. In this case you use the `initScriptsCM` and `initScriptsSecret` values.

```console
initScriptsCM=special-scripts
initScriptsSecret=special-scripts-sensitive
```

### Snapshot and restore operations

As it's described in the [official documentation](https://www.open.co/guide/en/opensearch/reference/current/snapshots-register-repository.html#snapshots-filesystem-repository), it's necessary to register a snapshot repository before you can perform snapshot and restore operations.

This chart allows you to configure OpenSearch to use a shared file system to store snapshots. To do so, you need to mount a RWX volume on every OpenSearch node, and set the parameter `snapshotRepoPath` with the path where the volume is mounted. In the example below, you can find the values to set when using a NFS Persistent Volume:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: snapshot-repository
    nfs:
      server: nfs.example.com # Please change this to your NFS server
      path: /share1
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: snapshot-repository
    mountPath: /snapshots
snapshotRepoPath: "/snapshots"
```

### Sidecars and Init Containers

If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as OpenSearch components (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the `XXX.sidecars` parameter(s), where XXX is placeholder you need to replace with the actual component(s). Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

```yaml
sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

Similarly, you can add extra init containers using the `initContainers` parameter.

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
```

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `XXX.affinity` parameter(s). Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `XXX.podAffinityPreset`, `XXX.podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `XXX.nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

## Persistence

The [Bitnami OpenSearch](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/opensearch) image stores the OpenSearch data at the `/bitnami/opensearch/data` path of the container.

By default, the chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) at this location. The volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning. See the [Parameters](#parameters) section to configure the PVC.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the image run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set name=my-open,client.service.port=8080 \
  oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/opensearch
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The above command sets the OpenSearch cluster name to `my-open` and REST port number to `8080`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/opensearch
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/opensearch/values.yaml).

## Upgrading

### To 1.0.0

This major bump changes the following security defaults:

- `runAsGroup` is changed from `0` to `1001`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is set to `true`
- `resourcesPreset` is changed from `none` to the minimum size working in our test suites (NOTE: `resourcesPreset` is not meant for production usage, but `resources` adapted to your use case).
- `global.compatibility.openshift.adaptSecurityContext` is changed from `disabled` to `auto`.

This could potentially break any customization or init scripts used in your deployment. If this is the case, change the default values to the previous ones.
