                      be limited, according to the `checkpoint_completion_target` setting on
                      the PostgreSQL server. If set to true, an immediate checkpoint will be

                      possible. `false` by default.

                      If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed,
                      without waiting for WAL to be archived.
                      This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                      Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.
                      By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is
                      enabled.
                      On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                      If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger
                      an immediate segment switch.
