                              If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed,
                              without waiting for WAL to be archived.
                              This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                              Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.
                              By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is
                              enabled.
                              On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                              If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger
                              an immediate segment switch.

                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                                        Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                                        The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                                        propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                                        The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                                        Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                                        Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                                        through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                                        "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                        to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                        specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                        EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                        allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                        than a virtual IP.
                                        "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                        routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                        "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                        (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                        as the clusterIP.
                                        "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.

                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same

                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.

                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                        of pods into each bucket.

                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                          skew.
                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |

                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
