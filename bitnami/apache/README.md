# Apache

The [Apache HTTP Server Project](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") was launched in 1995 and it has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. It has celebrated its 20th birthday as a project in February 2015.

## TL;DR

```bash
$ helm install bitnami/apache
```

## Introduction

Bitnami charts for Helm are carefully engineered, actively maintained and are the quickest and easiest way to deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster that are ready to handle production workloads.

This chart bootstraps a [Apache](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release bitnami/apache
```

The command deploys Apache on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the Apache chart and their default values.

| Parameter                         | Description                           | Default                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image.registry`                  | Apache image registry                 | `docker.io`                                               |
| `image.repository`                | Apache Image name                     | `bitnami/apache`                                          |
| `image.tag`                       | Apache Image tag                      | `{VERSION}`                                               |
| `image.pullPolicy`                | Apache image pull policy              | `Always`                                                  |
| `image.pullSecrets`               | Specify image pull secrets            | `nil` (does not add image pull secrets to deployed pods)  |

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release \
  --set imagePullPolicy=Always \
    bitnami/apache
```

The above command sets the `imagePullPolicy` to `Always`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml bitnami/apache
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Upgrading

### To 2.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 2.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is apache:

```console
$ kubectl patch deployment apache --type=json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/selector/matchLabels/chart"}]'
```
