## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/rabbitmq
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The command deploys RabbitMQ on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcesPreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### Prometheus metrics

This chart can be integrated with Prometheus by setting `metrics.enabled` to `true`. This enable the  [rabbitmq_prometheus plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/c4d9a840c2611290a128ab6d914d2791e2ff302d/deps/rabbitmq_prometheus) and expose a metrics endpoints in all pods and the RabbitMQ service. The service will have the necessary annotations to be automatically scraped by Prometheus.

#### Prometheus requirements

It is necessary to have a working installation of Prometheus or Prometheus Operator for the integration to work. Install the [Bitnami Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/prometheus) or the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) to easily have a working Prometheus in your cluster.

#### Integration with Prometheus Operator

The chart can deploy `ServiceMonitor` objects for integration with Prometheus Operator installations. There are different `ServiceMonitor` objects per RabbitMQ endpoins. The chart includes:

- `metrics.serviceMonitor.default` for the `/metrics` endpoint.
- `metrics.serviceMonitor.perObject` for the `/metrics/per-object` endpoint.
- `metrics.serviceMonitor.detailed` for the `/metrics/detailed` endpoint.

Enable each ServiceMonitor by setting `metrics.serviceMonitor.*.enabled=true`. Ensure that the Prometheus Operator `CustomResourceDefinitions` are installed in the cluster or it will fail with the following error:

```text
no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
```

Install the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) for having the necessary CRDs and the Prometheus Operator.

### [Rolling vs Immutable tags](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Set pod affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

### Scale horizontally

To horizontally scale this chart once it has been deployed, two options are available:

- Use the `kubectl scale` command.
- Upgrade the chart modifying the `replicaCount` parameter.

```text
    replicaCount=3
    auth.password="$RABBITMQ_PASSWORD"
    auth.erlangCookie="$RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE"
```

> NOTE: It is mandatory to specify the password and Erlang cookie that was set the first time the chart was installed when upgrading the chart. Otherwise, new pods won't be able to join the cluster.

When scaling down the solution, unnecessary RabbitMQ nodes are automatically stopped, but they are not removed from the cluster. These nodes must be manually removed via the `rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node` command.

For instance, if RabbitMQ was initially installed with three replicas and then scaled down to two replicas, run the commands below (assuming that the release name is `rabbitmq` and the clustering type is `hostname`):

```console
    kubectl exec rabbitmq-0 --container rabbitmq -- rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node rabbit@rabbitmq-2.rabbitmq-headless.default.svc.cluster.local
    kubectl delete pvc data-rabbitmq-2
```

> NOTE: It is mandatory to specify the password and Erlang cookie that was set the first time the chart was installed when upgrading the chart.

### Securing traffic using TLS

To enable TLS support, first generate the certificates as described in the [RabbitMQ documentation for SSL certificate generation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html#automated-certificate-generation).

Once the certificates are generated, you have two alternatives:

- Create a secret with the certificates and associate the secret when deploying the chart
- Include the certificates in the *values.yaml* file when deploying the chart

Set the *auth.tls.failIfNoPeerCert* parameter to *false* to allow a TLS connection if the client fails to provide a certificate.

Set the *auth.tls.sslOptionsVerify* to *verify_peer* to force a node to perform peer verification. When set to *verify_none*, peer verification will be disabled and certificate exchange won't be performed.

This chart also facilitates the creation of TLS secrets for use with the Ingress controller (although this is not mandatory). There are several common use cases:

- Generate certificate secrets based on chart parameters.
- Enable externally generated certificates.
- Manage application certificates via an external service (like [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/)).
- Create self-signed certificates within the chart (if supported).

In the first two cases, a certificate and a key are needed. Files are expected in `.pem` format.

Here is an example of a certificate file:

> NOTE: There may be more than one certificate if there is a certificate chain.

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID6TCCAtGgAwIBAgIJAIaCwivkeB5EMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFYxCzAJBgNV
...
jScrvkiBO65F46KioCL9h5tDvomdU1aqpI/CBzhvZn1c0ZTf87tGQR8NK7v7
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Here is an example of a certificate key:

```text
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvLYcyu8f3skuRyUgeeNpeDvYBCDcgq+LsWap6zbX5f8oLqp4
...
wrj2wDbCDCFmfqnSJ+dKI3vFLlEz44sAV8jX/kd4Y6ZTQhlLbYc=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

- If using Helm to manage the certificates based on the parameters, copy these values into the `certificate` and `key` values for a given `*.ingress.secrets` entry.
- If managing TLS secrets separately, it is necessary to create a TLS secret with name `INGRESS_HOSTNAME-tls` (where INGRESS_HOSTNAME is a placeholder to be replaced with the hostname you set using the `*.ingress.hostname` parameter).
- If your cluster has a [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates, add to `*.ingress.annotations` the [corresponding ones](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/#supported-annotations) for cert-manager.
- If using self-signed certificates created by Helm, set both `*.ingress.tls` and `*.ingress.selfSigned` to `true`.

### Load custom definitions

It is possible to [load a RabbitMQ definitions file to configure RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html#load-definitions). Follow the steps below:

Because definitions may contain RabbitMQ credentials, [store the JSON as a Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-files-from-a-pod). Within the secret's data, choose a key name that corresponds with the desired load definitions filename (i.e. `load_definition.json`) and use the JSON object as the value.

Next, specify the `load_definitions` property as an `extraConfiguration` pointing to the load definition file path within the container (i.e. `/app/load_definition.json`) and set `loadDefinition.enable` to `true`. Any load definitions specified will be available within in the container at `/app`.

> NOTE: Loading a definition will take precedence over any configuration done through [Helm values](#parameters).

If needed, you can use `extraSecrets` to let the chart create the secret for you. This way, you don't need to manually create it before deploying a release. These secrets can also be templated to use supplied chart values. Here is an example:

```yaml
auth:
  password: CHANGEME
extraSecrets:
  load-definition:
    load_definition.json: |
      {
        "users": [
          {
            "name": "{{ .Values.auth.username }}",
            "password": "{{ .Values.auth.password }}",
            "tags": "administrator"
          }
        ],
        "vhosts": [
          {
            "name": "/"
          }
        ]
      }
loadDefinition:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: load-definition
extraConfiguration: |
  load_definitions = /app/load_definition.json
```

### Update credentials

The Bitnami RabbitMQ chart, when upgrading, reuses the secret previously rendered by the chart or the one specified in `auth.existingSecret`. To update credentials, use one of the following:

- Run `helm upgrade` specifying a new password in `auth.password` and `auth.updatePassword=true`.
- Run `helm upgrade` specifying a new secret in `auth.existingSecret` and `auth.updatePassword=true`.

### Configure LDAP support

LDAP support can be enabled in the chart by specifying the `ldap.*` parameters while creating a release. For example:

```text
ldap.enabled="true"
ldap.server="my-ldap-server"
ldap.port="389"
ldap.user_dn_pattern="cn=${username},dc=example,dc=org"
```

If `ldap.tls.enabled` is set to true, consider using `ldap.port=636` and checking the settings in the `advancedConfiguration` chart parameters.

### Configure memory high watermark

It is possible to configure a memory high watermark on RabbitMQ to define [memory thresholds](https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#threshold) using the `memoryHighWatermark.*` parameters. To do so, you have two alternatives:

- Set an absolute limit of RAM to be used on each RabbitMQ node, as shown in the configuration example below:

```text
memoryHighWatermark.enabled="true"
memoryHighWatermark.type="absolute"
memoryHighWatermark.value="512Mi"
```

- Set a relative limit of RAM to be used on each RabbitMQ node. To enable this feature,  define the memory limits at pod level too. An example configuration is shown below:

```text
memoryHighWatermark.enabled="true"
memoryHighWatermark.type="relative"
memoryHighWatermark.value="0.4"
resources.limits.memory="2Gi"
```

### Add extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: LOG_LEVEL
    value: error
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `.extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` properties.

### Configure the default user/vhost

If you want to create default user/vhost and set the default permission. you can use `extraConfiguration`:

```yaml
auth:
  username: default-user
extraConfiguration: |-
  default_vhost = default-vhost
  default_permissions.configure = .*
  default_permissions.read = .*
  default_permissions.write = .*
```

### Use plugins

The Bitnami Docker RabbitMQ image ships a set of plugins by default. By default, this chart enables `rabbitmq_management` and `rabbitmq_peer_discovery_k8s` since they are required for RabbitMQ to work on K8s.

To enable extra plugins, set the `extraPlugins` parameter with the list of plugins you want to enable. In addition to this, the `communityPlugins` parameter can be used to specify a list of URLs (separated by spaces) for custom plugins for RabbitMQ.

```text
communityPlugins="http://URL-TO-PLUGIN/"
extraPlugins="my-custom-plugin"
```

### Advanced logging

In case you want to configure RabbitMQ logging set `logs` value to false and set the log config in extraConfiguration following the [official documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/logging.html#log-file-location).

An example:

```yaml
logs: false # custom logging
extraConfiguration: |
  log.default.level = warning
  log.file = false
  log.console = true
  log.console.level = warning
  log.console.formatter = json
```

### How to Avoid Deadlocked Deployments After a Cluster-Wide Restart

RabbitMQ nodes assume their peers come back online within five minutes (by default). When the `OrderedReady` pod management policy is used with a readiness probe that implicitly requires a fully booted node, the deployment can deadlock:

- Kubernetes will expect the first node to pass a readiness probe
- The readiness probe may require a fully booted node
- The node will fully boot after it detects that its peers have come online
- Kubernetes will not start any more pods until the first one boots

The following combination of deployment settings avoids the problem:

- Use `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"` to boot multiple cluster nodes in parallel
- Use `rabbitmq-diagnostics ping` for readiness probe

To learn more, please consult RabbitMQ documentation guides:

- [RabbitMQ Clustering guide: Node Restarts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/clustering#restarting)
- [RabbitMQ Clustering guide: Restarts and Readiness Probes](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/clustering#restarting-readiness-probes)
- [Recommendations](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/cluster-formation#peer-discovery-k8s) for Operator-less (DIY) deployments to Kubernetes

#### Do Not Force Boot Nodes on a Regular Basis

Note that forcing nodes to boot is **not a solution** and doing so **can be dangerous**. Forced booting is a last resort mechanism in RabbitMQ that helps make remaining cluster nodes recover and rejoin each other after a permanent loss of some of their former peers. In other words, forced booting a node is an emergency event recovery procedure.

### Known issues

- Changing the password through RabbitMQ's UI can make the pod fail due to the default liveness probes. If you do so, remember to make the chart aware of the new password. Updating the default secret with the password you set through RabbitMQ's UI will automatically recreate the pods. If you are using your own secret, you may have to manually recreate the pods.

### Backup and restore

To back up and restore Helm chart deployments on Kubernetes, you need to back up the persistent volumes from the source deployment and attach them to a new deployment using [Velero](https://velero.io/), a Kubernetes backup/restore tool. Find the instructions for using Velero in [this guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-backup-restore-deployments-velero-index.html).

## Persistence

The [Bitnami RabbitMQ](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq) image stores the RabbitMQ data and configurations at the `/opt/bitnami/rabbitmq/var/lib/rabbitmq/` path of the container.

The chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) at this location. By default, the volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning. An existing PersistentVolumeClaim can also be defined.

### Use existing PersistentVolumeClaims

1. Create the PersistentVolume
2. Create the PersistentVolumeClaim
3. Install the chart

```console
helm install my-release --set persistence.existingClaim=PVC_NAME oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/rabbitmq
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

### Adjust permissions of the persistence volume mountpoint

As the image runs as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an `initContainer` to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this `initContainer` by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

## Prometheus Metrics

RabbitMQ has [built-in support](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/prometheus#default-endpoint) for Prometheus metrics
exposed at `GET /metrics`. However, these metrics are all cluster-wide, and do not show any per-queue or per-node
metrics.

To get per-object metrics, there is a
[second metrics endpoint](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/prometheus#detailed-endpoint) at `GET /metrics/detailed` that
accepts query parameters to choose which metric families you would like to see. For instance, you can pass
`family=node_coarse_metrics&family=queue_coarse_metrics` to see per-node and per-queue metrics, but with no need to see
Erlang, connection, or channel metrics.

Additionally, there is a [third metrics endpoint](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/prometheus#per-object-endpoint):
`GET /metrics/per-object`. which returns *all* per-object metrics. However, this can be computationally expensive on a
large cluster with many objects, and so RabbitMQ docs suggest using `GET /metrics/detailed` mentioned above to filter
your scraping and only fetch the per-object metrics that are needed for a given monitoring application.

Because they expose different sets of data, a valid use case is to scrape metrics from both `GET /metrics` and
`GET /metrics/detailed`, ingesting both cluster-level and per-object metrics. The `metrics.serviceMonitor.default` and
`metrics.serviceMonitor.detailed` values support configuring a ServiceMonitor that targets one or both of these metrics.

The above parameters map to the env variables defined in [bitnami/rabbitmq](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq). For more information please refer to the [bitnami/rabbitmq](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq) image documentation.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set auth.username=admin,auth.password=secretpassword,auth.erlangCookie=secretcookie \
    oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/rabbitmq
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The above command sets the RabbitMQ admin username and password to `admin` and `secretpassword` respectively. Additionally the secure erlang cookie is set to `secretcookie`.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/rabbitmq
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq/values.yaml)

## Upgrading

### To 15.2.0

This version introduces image verification for security purposes. To disable it, set `global.security.allowInsecureImages` to `true`. More details at [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/30850).

It's necessary to set the `auth.password` and `auth.erlangCookie` parameters when upgrading for readiness/liveness probes to work properly. When you install this chart for the first time, some notes will be displayed providing the credentials you must use under the 'Credentials' section. Please note down the password and the cookie, and run the command below to upgrade your chart:

```console
helm upgrade my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/rabbitmq --set auth.password=[PASSWORD] --set auth.erlangCookie=[RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE]
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

| Note: you need to substitute the placeholders [PASSWORD] and [RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE] with the values obtained in the installation notes.

### To 15.0.0

This major updates RabbitMQ subchart to 4.0.1. For more information on this subchart's major, please refer to [RabbitMQ upgrade notes](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/4.0/upgrade).

### To 14.0.0

This major version changes the default RabbitMQ image from 3.12.x to 3.13.x. Follow the [official instructions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) to upgrade from 3.12 to 3.13.

### To 13.0.0

This major bump changes the following security defaults:

- `runAsGroup` is changed from `0` to `1001`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is set to `true`
- `resourcesPreset` is changed from `none` to the minimum size working in our test suites (NOTE: `resourcesPreset` is not meant for production usage, but `resources` adapted to your use case).
- `global.compatibility.openshift.adaptSecurityContext` is changed from `disabled` to `auto`.

This could potentially break any customization or init scripts used in your deployment. If this is the case, change the default values to the previous ones.

### To 12.10.0

This version adds NetworkPolicy objects by default. Its default configuration is setting open `egress` (this can be changed by setting `networkPolicy.allowExternalEgress=false`) and limited `ingress` to the default container ports. If you have any extra port exposed you may need to set the `networkPolicy.extraIngress` value. In the example below an extra port is exposed using `extraContainerPorts` and access is allowed using `networkPolicy.extraIngress`:

```yaml
  extraContainerPorts:
    - name: "mqtts"
      protocol: "TCP"
      containerPort: 8883
  networkPolicy:
    extraIngress:
      - ports:
          - protocol: "TCP"
            containerPort: 8883
            port: 8883
```

You can revert this behavior by setting `networkPolicy.enabled=false`.

### To 11.0.0

This major version changes the default RabbitMQ image from 3.10.x to 3.11.x. Follow the [official instructions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) to upgrade from 3.10 to 3.11.

### To 10.0.0

This major version changes the default RabbitMQ image from 3.9.x to 3.10.x. Follow the [official instructions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) to upgrade from 3.9 to 3.10.

### To 9.0.0

This major release renames several values in this chart and adds missing features, in order to be aligned with the rest of the assets in the Bitnami charts repository.

- `service.metricsPortName` has been renamed as `service.portNames.metrics`.
- `service.metricsNodePort` has been renamed as `service.nodePorts.metrics`.
- `persistence.volumes` has been removed, as it duplicates the parameter `extraVolumes`.
- `ingress.certManager` has been removed.
- `metrics.serviceMonitor.relabellings` has been replaced with `metrics.serviceMonitor.relabelings`, and it sets the field `relabelings` instead of `metricRelabelings`.
- `metrics.serviceMonitor.additionalLabels` has been renamed as `metrics.serviceMonitor.labels`
- `updateStrategyType` has been removed, use the field `updateStrategy` instead, which is interpreted as a template.
- The content of `podSecurityContext` and `containerSecurityContext` have been modified.
- The behavior of VolumePermissions has been modified to not change ownership of '.snapshot' and 'lost+found'
- Introduced the values `ContainerPorts.*`, separating the service and container ports configuration.

### To 8.21.0

This new version of the chart bumps the RabbitMQ version to `3.9.1`. It is considered a minor release, and no breaking changes are expected. Additionally, RabbitMQ `3.9.X` nodes can run alongside `3.8.X` nodes.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) and the [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for further documentation.

### To 8.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

### To 7.0.0

- Several parameters were renamed or disappeared in favor of new ones on this major version:
  - `replicas` is renamed to `replicaCount`.
  - `securityContext.*` is deprecated in favor of `podSecurityContext` and `containerSecurityContext`.
  - Authentication parameters were reorganized under the `auth.*` parameter:
    - `rabbitmq.username`, `rabbitmq.password`, and `rabbitmq.erlangCookie` are now `auth.username`, `auth.password`, and `auth.erlangCookie` respectively.
    - `rabbitmq.tls.*` parameters are now under `auth.tls.*`.
  - Parameters prefixed with `rabbitmq.` were renamed removing the prefix. E.g. `rabbitmq.configuration` -> renamed to `configuration`.
  - `rabbitmq.rabbitmqClusterNodeName` is deprecated.
  - `rabbitmq.setUlimitNofiles` is deprecated.
  - `forceBoot.enabled` is renamed to `clustering.forceBoot`.
  - `loadDefinition.secretName` is renamed to `loadDefinition.existingSecret`.
  - `metics.port` is remamed to `service.metricsPort`.
  - `service.extraContainerPorts` is renamed to `extraContainerPorts`.
  - `service.nodeTlsPort` is renamed to `service.tlsNodePort`.
  - `podDisruptionBudget` is deprecated in favor of `pdb.create`, `pdb.minAvailable`, and `pdb.maxUnavailable`.
  - `rbacEnabled` -> deprecated in favor of `rbac.create`.
  - New parameters: `serviceAccount.create`, and `serviceAccount.name`.
  - New parameters: `memoryHighWatermark.enabled`, `memoryHighWatermark.type`, and `memoryHighWatermark.value`.
- Chart labels and Ingress configuration were adapted to follow the Helm charts best practices.
- Initialization logic now relies on the container.
- This version introduces `bitnami/common`, a [library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/#helm) as a dependency. More documentation about this new utility could be found [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#bitnami-common-library-chart). Please, make sure that you have updated the chart dependencies before executing any upgrade.
- The layout of the persistent volumes has changed (if using persistence). Action is required if preserving data through the upgrade is desired:
  - The data has moved from `mnesia/` within the persistent volume to the root of the persistent volume
  - The `config/` and `schema/` directories within the persistent volume are no longer used
  - An init container can be used to move and clean up the peristent volumes. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/10913#issuecomment-1169619513).
  - Alternately the value `persistence.subPath` can be overridden to be `mnesia` so that the directory layout is consistent with what it was previously.
    - Note however that this will leave the unused `config/` and `schema/` directories within the peristent volume forever.

Consequences:

- Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
- Compatibility with non Bitnami images is not guaranteed anymore.

### To 6.0.0

This new version updates the RabbitMQ image to a [new version based on bash instead of node.js](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq#3715-r18-3715-ol-7-r19). However, since this Chart overwrites the container's command, the changes to the container shouldn't affect the Chart. To upgrade, it may be needed to enable the `fastBoot` option, as it is already the case from upgrading from 5.X to 5.Y.

### To 5.0.0

This major release changes the clustering method from `ip` to `hostname`.
This change is needed to fix the persistence. The data dir will now depend on the hostname which is stable instead of the pod IP that might change.

> IMPORTANT: Note that if you upgrade from a previous version you will lose your data.

### To 3.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 3.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is rabbitmq:

```console
kubectl delete statefulset rabbitmq --cascade=false
```
