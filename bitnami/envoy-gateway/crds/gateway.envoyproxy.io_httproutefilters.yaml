                  HTTPCredentialInjectionFilter defines the configuration to inject credentials into the request.
                  This is useful when the backend service requires credentials in the request, and the original
                  request does not contain them. The filter can inject credentials into the request before forwarding
                  it to the backend service.

                          "credential", and the value should be the credential to be injected.
                          For example, for basic authentication, the value should be "Basic <base64 encoded username:password>".
                          for bearer token, the value should be "Bearer <token>".
                          Note: The secret must be in the same namespace as the HTTPRouteFilter.
