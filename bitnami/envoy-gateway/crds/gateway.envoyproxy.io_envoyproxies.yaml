                  to learn more about the syntax.
                  If set, this is the Bootstrap configuration used for the managed Envoy Proxy fleet instead of the default Bootstrap configuration
                  set by Envoy Gateway.
                  Some fields within the Bootstrap that are required to communicate with the xDS Server (Envoy Gateway) and receive xDS resources
                  from it are not configurable and will result in the `EnvoyProxy` resource being rejected.
                  Backward compatibility across minor versions is not guaranteed.
                  We strongly recommend using `egctl x translate` to generate a `EnvoyProxy` resource with the `Bootstrap` field set to the default
                  Bootstrap configuration used. You can edit this configuration, and rerun `egctl x translate` to ensure there are no validation errors.

                  If unspecified, the default filter order is applied.
                  Default filter order is:

                  - envoy.filters.http.health_check

                  - envoy.filters.http.fault

                                        mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host
                                        to container and the other way around.
                                        When not set, MountPropagationNone is used.
                                        This field is beta in 1.10.
                                        When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified
                                        (which defaults to None).

                                        RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                        recursively.

                                        If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                        If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                        recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                        recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                        field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                        supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                        an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                        If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                        None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                        If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                        And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                        WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                        the spread constraint.
                                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.

                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.

                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such

                                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.

                                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                  Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

                                                  ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                                                  combination of signer name and a label selector.

                                                  Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                                  into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                                  comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                                  The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                                  may change the order over time.

                                      Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                      This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                      Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                                      Default value is 0.
                                      Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                      that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                      can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                      The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                      pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                      on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                      reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                      pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                      Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                      daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                      so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                      cause evictions during disruption.

                                      number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute
                                      number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                                      This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0
                                      Default value is 1.
                                      Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                      that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                      can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                                      starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                      up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                      it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                      70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                      the update.

                                        PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                        API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                    This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,

                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.

                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.

                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.
                                      properties:

                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                    the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                    provisioner.
                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.
                                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                      set, the default cluster-wide tolerance is applied (by default 10%).

                                      For example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of 100Mi,
                                      and scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively, scaling will be
                                      triggered when the actual consumption falls below 95Mi or exceeds 101Mi.

                                    Multiple fallback backends can be configured.
                                    It is highly recommended to configure active or passive health checks to ensure that failover can be detected
                                    when the active backends become unhealthy and to automatically readjust once the primary backends are healthy again.
                                    The overprovisioning factor is set to 1.4, meaning the fallback backends will only start receiving traffic when
