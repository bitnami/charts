                  description: "DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of the condition. \n `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False. \n `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False. \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason. \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors` slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity. When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry."
