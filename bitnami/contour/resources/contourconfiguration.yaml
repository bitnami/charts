                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in

                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour. The details of the errors will be present under

                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in
