                                        they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                        in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource

                                        and the other is non-empty. When namespace

                                        isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between
                                        dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                                        only allows two specific types of objects,
                                        dataSourceRef allows any non-core object,
                                        as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                        (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all
                                        values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is specified. * While dataSource only
                                        allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                        objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
