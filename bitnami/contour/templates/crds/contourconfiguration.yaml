                    not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour. The details of the errors will be present under
                    the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in
