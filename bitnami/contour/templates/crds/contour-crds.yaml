                    DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra

                    of the condition.
                    `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`.
                    `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
                    In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors.
                    `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors`
                    slice in this case.
                    `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.
                    The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`.
                    For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice.
                    When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice.
                    In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
                    Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason
                    (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or
                    `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.

                                  The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                  pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                  on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                  reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                  pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                  Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                  daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                  so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                  cause evictions during disruption.

                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).
                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.
                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.
                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).
                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                    DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra
                    fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False)
                    of the condition.
                    `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`.
                    `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
                    In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors.
                    `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors`
                    slice in this case.
                    `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.
                    The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`.
                    For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice.
                    When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice.
                    In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
                    Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason
                    (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or
                    `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.

                            NOTE: Setting Weight explicitly to 0 will unexpectedly result in 100% traffic mirroring. This
                            occurs since we cannot distinguish omitted fields from those explicitly set to their default

                                will only perform a lookup for addresses in the IPv6 family.
                                If "all" is configured, the DNS resolver
                                will perform a lookup for addresses in both the IPv4 and IPv6 family.
                                If "auto" is configured, the DNS resolver will first perform a lookup
                                for addresses in the IPv6 family and fallback to a lookup for addresses
                                in the IPv4 family. If not specified, the Contour-wide setting defined
                                in the config file or ContourConfiguration applies (defaults to "auto").

                    DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra
                    fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False)
                    of the condition.
                    `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`.
                    `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
                    In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors.
                    `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors`
                    slice in this case.
                    `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.
                    The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`.
                    For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice.
                    When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice.
                    In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
                    Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason
                    (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or
                    `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.

                  That is, when `currentStatus` is `valid`, the `Valid` condition will be `status: true`,
                  and vice versa.
                  Contour will leave untouched any other Conditions set in this block,
                  in case some other controller wants to add a Condition.
                  If you are another controller owner and wish to add a condition, you *should*

                    DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra
                    fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False)
                    of the condition.
                    `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`.
                    `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
                    In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors.
                    `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors`
                    slice in this case.
                    `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.
                    The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`.
                    For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice.
                    When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice.
                    In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
                    Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason
                    (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or
                    `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.

                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

                          SubCondition is a Condition-like type intended for use as a subcondition inside a DetailedCondition.
                          It contains a subset of the Condition fields.
                          It is intended for warnings and errors, so `type` names should use abnormal-true polarity,
                          that is, they should be of the form "ErrorPresent: true".
                          The expected lifecycle for these errors is that they should only be present when the error or warning is,
                          and should be removed when they are not relevant.
