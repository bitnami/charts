## Introduction

Bitnami charts for Helm are carefully engineered, actively maintained and are the quickest and easiest way to deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster that are ready to handle production workloads.

This chart bootstraps a [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium) deployment in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- Nodes with Linux kernel >= 4.19.57 or equivalent (e.g., 4.18 on RHEL8)

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/cilium
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The command deploys Cilium on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### External Key-Value Store support

You may want to have Cilium connect to an external key-value store rather than installing one inside your cluster. Typical reasons for this are to use a managed service, or to share a common store for all your applications. To achieve this, the chart allows you to specify credentials for an external database with the [`externalKvstore` parameter](#parameters). You should also disable the etcd installation with the `etcd.enabled` option. Here is an example:

```console
etcd.enabled=false
externalKvstorehost.enabled=true
externalKvstorehost.endpoints[0]=external-kvstore-host-0:2379
externalKvstorehost.endpoints[1]=external-kvstore-host-1:2379
```

### Cilium CNI plugin

Please also note the chart installs the Cilium CNI plugin on the Kubernetes nodes by default. If you want to disable this behavior, set the `agent.cniPlugin.install` parameter to `false`.

It's also necessary to know the paths where the CNI binary and configuration files are located in your Kubernetes nodes. The chart assumes that the CNI binary is located in the `/opt/cni/bin` directory and the CNI configuration files are located in the `/etc/cni/net.d` directory. You can customize these paths using the `agent.cniPlugin.hostCNIBinDir` and `agent.cniPlugin.hostCNINetDir` parameters.

### Securing traffic using TLS

This chart supports encrypting communications between Hubble components using TLS. To enable this feature, set the `hubble.tls.enabled`.

It is necessary to create a secret containing the TLS certificates and pass it to the chart via the `hubble.tls.existingCASecret`, `hubble.tls.peers.existingSecret`, `hubble.tls.relay.existingSecret` and `hubble.tls.client.existingSecret` parameters. Every secret should contain a `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys including the certificate and key files respectively. For example: create the CA secret with the certificates files:

```console
kubectl create secret generic ca-tls-secret --from-file=./tls.crt --from-file=./tls.key
```

You can manually create the required TLS certificates or relying on the chart auto-generation capabilities. The chart supports two different ways to auto-generate the required certificates:

- Using Helm capabilities. Enable this feature by setting `hubble.tls.autoGenerated.enabled` to `true` and `hubble.tls.autoGenerated.engine` to `helm`.
- Relying on CertManager (please note it's required to have CertManager installed in your K8s cluster). Enable this feature by setting `hubble.tls.autoGenerated.enabled` to `true` and `hubble.tls.autoGenerated.engine` to `cert-manager`. Please note it's supported to use an existing Issuer/ClusterIssuer for issuing the TLS certificates by setting the `hubble.tls.autoGenerated.certManager.existingIssuer` and `hubble.tls.autoGenerated.certManager.existingIssuerKind` parameters.

### Backup and restore

To back up and restore Helm chart deployments on Kubernetes, you need to back up the persistent volumes from the source deployment and attach them to a new deployment using [Velero](https://velero.io/), a Kubernetes backup/restore tool. Find the instructions for using Velero in [this guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-backup-restore-deployments-velero-index.html).

### Prometheus metrics

This chart can be integrated with Prometheus by setting `*.metrics.enabled` (under the `agent`, `envoy`, `operator`, `hubble.peers` and `hubble.relay` sections) to `true`. This will expose the Cilium, Hubble and Envoy native Prometheus ports in the containers. Additionally, it will deploy several `metrics` services, which can be configured under the `*.metrics.service` section (under the `agent`, `envoy`, `operator`, `hubble.peers` and `hubble.relay` sections). These `metrics` services will have the necessary annotations to be automatically scraped by Prometheus.

#### Prometheus requirements

It is necessary to have a working installation of Prometheus or Prometheus Operator for the integration to work. Install the [Bitnami Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/prometheus) or the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) to easily have a working Prometheus in your cluster.

#### Integration with Prometheus Operator

The chart can deploy `ServiceMonitor` objects for integration with Prometheus Operator installations. To do so, set the value `*.metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true` (under the `agent`, `envoy`, `operator`, `hubble.peers` and `hubble.relay` sections). Ensure that the Prometheus Operator `CustomResourceDefinitions` are installed in the cluster or it will fail with the following error:

```text
no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
```

Install the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) for having the necessary CRDs and the Prometheus Operator.

### Ingress

This chart provides support for Ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress-controller](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller) or [contour](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/contour) you can utilize the ingress controller to serve Hubble UI. To enable Ingress integration, set `hubble.ui.enabled` and `hubble.ui.ingress.enabled` to `true`.

The most common scenario is to have one host name mapped to the deployment. In this case, the `hubble.ui.ingress.hostname` property can be used to set the host name. The `ui.ingress.tls` parameter can be used to add the TLS configuration for this host.

However, it is also possible to have more than one host. To facilitate this, the `hubble.ui.ingress.extraHosts` parameter (if available) can be set with the host names specified as an array. The `hubble.ui.ingress.extraTLS` parameter (if available) can also be used to add the TLS configuration for extra hosts.

> NOTE: For each host specified in the `hubble.ui.ingress.extraHosts` parameter, it is necessary to set a name, path, and any annotations that the Ingress controller should know about. Not all annotations are supported by all Ingress controllers, but [this annotation reference document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md) lists the annotations supported by many popular Ingress controllers.

Adding the TLS parameter (where available) will cause the chart to generate HTTPS URLs, and the application will be available on port 443. The actual TLS secrets do not have to be generated by this chart. However, if TLS is enabled, the Ingress record will not work until the TLS secret exists.

[Learn more about Ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).

### Additional environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property. For instance:

```yaml
agent:
  extraEnvVars:
    - name: LOG_LEVEL
      value: error
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Sidecars

If additional containers are needed in the same pod as Ciliuma (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the `agent.sidecars` parameter.

```yaml
agent:
  sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
    - name: portname
      containerPort: 1234
```

If these sidecars export extra ports, extra port definitions can be added using the `agent.service.extraPorts` parameter (where available), as shown in the example below:

```yaml
agent:
  service:
    extraPorts:
    - name: extraPort
      port: 11311
      targetPort: 11311
```

If additional init containers are needed in the same pod, they can be defined using the `agent.initContainers` parameter. Here is an example:

```yaml
agent:
  initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

Learn more about [sidecar containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) and [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/).

### Pod affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, use one of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/cilium
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/template/cilium/values.yaml)
