# The frontend service is the main reverse proxy used to access the Kubeapps UI
# To expose Kubeapps externally either configure the ingress object below or
# set frontend.service.type=LoadBalancer in the frontend configuration.

ingress:
  # Set to true to enable ingress record generation
  enabled: false

  # Set this to true in order to add the corresponding annotations for cert-manager

  # Ingress annotations done as key:value pairs
  # For a full list of possible ingress annotations, please see
  # ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/annotations.md
  #
  # If certManager is set to true, annotation kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true" will automatically be set
  annotations:
  #  kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    # Keep the connection open with the API server even if idle (the default is 60 seconds)

    ## If TLS is set to true, you must declare what secret will store the key/certificate for TLS
    tlsSecret: kubeapps.local-tls

  secrets:
  # If you're providing your own certificates, please use this to add the certificates as secrets
  # key and certificate should start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- or
  # -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  #
  # name should line up with a tlsSecret set further up
  # If you're using cert-manager, this is unneeded, as it will create the secret for you if it is not set
  #
  # It is also possible to create and manage the certificates outside of this helm chart
  # Please see README.md for more information
