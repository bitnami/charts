                     - When `stop` is `1` operator sets `Replicas: 0` in each StatefulSet. Thie leads to having all `Pods` and `Service` deleted. All PVCs are kept intact.
                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.
