## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Kibana](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/kibana) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/kibana \
  --set elasticsearch.hosts[0]=<Hostname of your ES instance> \
  --set elasticsearch.port=<port of your ES instance> \
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

This chart requires an Elasticsearch instance to work. You can use an already existing Elasticsearch instance. These commands deploy Kibana on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcesPreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### [Rolling vs Immutable tags](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Update credentials

Bitnami charts configure credentials at first boot. Any further change in the secrets or credentials require manual intervention. Follow these instructions:

- Update the user password in Elasticsearch following [the upstream documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/reset-password.html)
- Update the password secret with the new values (replace the SECRET_NAME and PASSWORD)

```shell
kubectl create secret generic SECRET_NAME --from-literal=kibana-password=PASSWORD --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Prometheus metrics

This chart can be integrated with Prometheus by setting `metrics.enabled` to `true`. This will expose Kibana native Prometheus endpoint in the service. It will have the necessary annotations to be automatically scraped by Prometheus.

> **IMPORTANT**: For Prometheus metrics to work, make sure that the [kibana-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/pjhampton/kibana-prometheus-exporter) plugin is installed. Check the [Install plugins](#install-plugins) section for instructions on how to install extra plugins.

#### Prometheus requirements

It is necessary to have a working installation of Prometheus or Prometheus Operator for the integration to work. Install the [Bitnami Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/prometheus) or the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) to easily have a working Prometheus in your cluster.

#### Integration with Prometheus Operator

The chart can deploy `ServiceMonitor` objects for integration with Prometheus Operator installations. To do so, set the value `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true`. Ensure that the Prometheus Operator `CustomResourceDefinitions` are installed in the cluster or it will fail with the following error:

```text
no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
```

Install the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) for having the necessary CRDs and the Prometheus Operator.

### Change Kibana version

To modify the application version used in this chart, specify a different version of the image using the `image.tag` parameter and/or a different repository using the `image.repository` parameter.

### Use custom configuration

The Bitnami Kibana chart supports using custom configuration settings. For example, to mount a custom `kibana.yml` you can create a ConfigMap like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfig
data:
  kibana.yml: |-
    # Raw text of the file
```

And now you need to pass the ConfigMap name, to the corresponding parameter: `configurationCM=myconfig`

An alternative is to provide extra configuration settings to the default kibana.yml that the chart deploys. This is done using the `extraConfiguration` value:

```yaml
extraConfiguration:
  "server.maxPayloadBytes": 1048576
  "server.pingTimeout": 1500
```

### Securing traffic using TLS

Kibana can be configured with TLS by setting `tls.enabled=true`. The chart allows two configuration options:

- Provide your own secret using the `tls.existingSecret` value.
- Have the chart auto-generate the certificates using `tls.autoGenerated=true`.

### Add extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: ELASTICSEARCH_VERSION
    value: 6
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Use custom initialization scripts

For advanced operations, the Bitnami Kibana chart allows using custom initialization scripts that will be mounted in `/docker-entrypoint.init-db`. Mount these extra scripts using a ConfigMap or a Secret (in case of sensitive data) and specify them via the `initScriptsCM` and `initScriptsSecret` chart parameters, as shown below:

```text
elasticsearch.hosts[0]=elasticsearch-host
elasticsearch.port=9200
initScriptsCM=special-scripts
initScriptsSecret=special-scripts-sensitive
```

### Install plugins

The Bitnami Kibana chart allows you to install a set of plugins at deployment time using the `plugins` chart parameter, as shown in the example below:

```text
elasticsearch.hosts[0]=elasticsearch-host
elasticsearch.port=9200
plugins[0]=https://github.com/fbaligand/kibana-enhanced-table/releases/download/v1.5.0/enhanced-table-1.5.0_7.3.2.zip
```

> **NOTE** Make sure that the plugin is available for the Kibana version you are deploying

### Import saved objects

If you have visualizations and dashboards (in NDJSON format) to import to Kibana, create a ConfigMap that includes them and then install the chart with the `savedObjects.configmap` chart parameter, as shown below:

```text
savedObjects.configmap=my-import
```

Alternatively, if the saved objects are available at a URL, import them with the `savedObjects.urls` chart parameter, as shown below:

```text
savedObjects.urls[0]=www.my-site.com/import.ndjson
```

### Use Sidecars and Init Containers

If additional containers are needed in the same pod (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the `sidecars` config parameter.

```yaml
sidecars:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
    containerPort: 1234
```

If these sidecars export extra ports, extra port definitions can be added using the `service.extraPorts` parameter (where available), as shown in the example below:

```yaml
service:
  extraPorts:
  - name: extraPort
    port: 11311
    targetPort: 11311
```

> NOTE: This Helm chart already includes sidecar containers for the Prometheus exporters (where applicable). These can be activated by adding the `--enable-metrics=true` parameter at deployment time. The `sidecars` parameter should therefore only be used for any extra sidecar containers.

If additional init containers are needed in the same pod, they can be defined using the `initContainers` parameter. Here is an example:

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

Learn more about [sidecar containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) and [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/).

#### Add a sample Elasticsearch container as sidecar

This chart requires an Elasticsearch instance to work. For production, the options are to use an already existing Elasticsearch instance or deploy the [Elasticsearch chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/elasticsearch) with the [`global.kibanaEnabled=true` parameter](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/elasticsearch#enable-bundled-kibana).

For testing purposes, use a sidecar Elasticsearch container setting the following parameters during the Kibana chart installation:

```text
elasticsearch.hosts[0]=localhost
elasticsearch.port=9200
sidecars[0].name=elasticsearch
sidecars[0].image=bitnami/elasticsearch:latest
sidecars[0].imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent
sidecars[0].ports[0].name=http
sidecars[0].ports[0].containerPort=9200
```

### Set Pod affinity

This chart allows you to set custom Pod affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod affinity in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use one of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

### Backup and restore

To back up and restore Helm chart deployments on Kubernetes, you need to back up the persistent volumes from the source deployment and attach them to a new deployment using [Velero](https://velero.io/), a Kubernetes backup/restore tool. Find the instructions for using Velero in [this guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-backup-restore-deployments-velero-index.html).

## Persistence

The [Bitnami Kibana](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/kibana) image can persist data. If enabled, the persisted path is `/bitnami/kibana` by default.

The chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) at this location. The volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning.

### Add extra volumes

The Bitnami Kibana chart supports mounting extra volumes (either PVCs, secrets or configmaps) by using the `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` property. This can be combined with advanced operations like adding extra init containers and sidecars.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the image run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set admin.user=admin-user oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/kibana
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The above command sets the Kibana admin user to `admin-user`.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/kibana
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kibana/values.yaml)

## Upgrading

### To 11.4.0

This version introduces image verification for security purposes. To disable it, set `global.security.allowInsecureImages` to `true`. More details at [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/30850).

### To 11.0.0

This major bump changes the following security defaults:

- `runAsGroup` is changed from `0` to `1001`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is set to `true`
- `resourcesPreset` is changed from `none` to the minimum size working in our test suites (NOTE: `resourcesPreset` is not meant for production usage, but `resources` adapted to your use case).
- `global.compatibility.openshift.adaptSecurityContext` is changed from `disabled` to `auto`.

This could potentially break any customization or init scripts used in your deployment. If this is the case, change the default values to the previous ones.

### To 10.0.0

This major release updates Kibana its latest verstion 8.x.x.
In addition, missing features have been added and values have been renamed, in order to get aligned with the rest of the assets in the Bitnami charts repository.

Affected values:

- `service.port` renamed as `service.ports.http`
- `service.nodePort` renamed as `service.nodePorts.http`
- `containerPort` renamed as `containerPorts.http`

Changes to Security related values:

- `elasticsearch.security.auth.kibanaUsername` has been removed. Kibana must be authenticates using the built-in user 'kibana_system'
- `elasticsearch.security.auth.kibanaPassword` has to provide the password for the kibana_system user, otherwise random password will be generated.
- `elasticsearch.security.auth.existingSecret` key kibana-password now references the password of the 'kibana_system' user.
- Two new values have been added: `elasticsearch.security.auth.createSystemUser` and `elasticsearchPasswordSecret`. If provided, the kibana container will use the 'elastic' user to create the 'kibana_system' user, using the password provided under `elasticsearch.security.auth.kibanaPassword`.

### To 9.0.0

This version updates the settings used to communicate Kibana with Elasticsearch, adapting it to Elasticsearch X-Pack Security features.

Previous setting `elasticsearch.tls` has been replaced with `elasticsearch.security.tls.enabled`. Other settings regarding certificate verification can be found under `elasticsearch.security.tls.*`, such as verification method and custom truststore.

Additionally, support for the Kibana server using TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS for port 5601) has been added.

### To 8.0.0

The Kibana container configuration logic was migrated to bash.

From this version onwards, Kibana container components are now licensed under the [Elastic License](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license) that is not currently accepted as an Open Source license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

Also, from now on, the Helm Chart will include the X-Pack plugin installed by default.

Regular upgrade is compatible from previous versions.

### To 6.2.0

This version introduces `bitnami/common`, a [library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/#helm) as a dependency. More documentation about this new utility could be found [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#bitnami-common-library-chart). Please, make sure that you have updated the chart dependencies before executing any upgrade.

### To 6.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support formally ended](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project). This major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

### To 5.0.0

This version does not include Elasticsearch as a bundled dependency. From now on, you should specify an external Elasticsearch instance using the `elasticsearch.hosts[]` and `elasticsearch.port` [parameters](#parameters).

### To 3.0.0

Helm performs a lookup for the object based on its group (apps), version (v1), and kind (Deployment). Also known as its GroupVersionKind, or GVK. Changing the GVK is considered a compatibility breaker from Kubernetes' point of view, so you cannot "upgrade" those objects to the new GVK in-place. Earlier versions of Helm 3 did not perform the lookup correctly which has since been fixed to match the spec.

In [4dfac075aacf74405e31ae5b27df4369e84eb0b0](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/commit/4dfac075aacf74405e31ae5b27df4369e84eb0b0) the `apiVersion` of the deployment resources was updated to `apps/v1` in tune with the api's deprecated, resulting in compatibility breakage.

This major version signifies this change.

### To 2.0.0

This version enabled by default an initContainer that modify some kernel settings to meet the Elasticsearch requirements.

Currently, Elasticsearch requires some changes in the kernel of the host machine to work as expected. If those values are not set in the underlying operating system, the ES containers fail to boot with ERROR messages. More information about these requirements can be found in the links below:

- [File Descriptor requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/file-descriptors.html)
- [Virtual memory requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html)

You can disable the initContainer using the `elasticsearch.sysctlImage.enabled=false` parameter.
