                  Conditions is a list of conditions that must be met for a resource to be deleted.
                  Conditions filter resources that have already been matched by the match constraints,
                  namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of conditions matches all resources.
                  There are a maximum of 64 conditions allowed.

                  The exact matching logic is (in order):
                    1. If ANY condition evaluates to FALSE, the policy is skipped.
                    2. If ALL conditions evaluate to TRUE, the policy is executed.

                      Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".

                      - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
                      For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
                      but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
                      a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.

                      - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
                      For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
                      and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
                      a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.

                    description: |-
                      NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based
                      on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
                      object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
                      object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
                      it never skips the policy.

                      For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
                      associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
                      follows:
                      "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "runlevel",
                            "operator": "NotIn",
                            "values": [
                              "0",
                              "1"
                            ]
                          }
                        ]
                      }

                      If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose
                      namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
                      you will set the selector as follows:
                      "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "environment",
