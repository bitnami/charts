                        'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests.
                        'request' - Attributes of the admission request(/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest).
                        'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
