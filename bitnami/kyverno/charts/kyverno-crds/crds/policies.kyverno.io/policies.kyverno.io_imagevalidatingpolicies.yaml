                        The key is combined with the resource name of the
                        ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to construct an audit annotation key:

                        and the same audit annotation key, the annotation key will be identical.

                        a string or null value. If the expression evaluates to a string, the
                        audit annotation is included with the string value. If the expression
                        evaluates to null or empty string the audit annotation will be omitted.

                        API request, then the valueExpression will be evaluated for

                      - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
                      For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,

                      - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
                      For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,

                    description: |-
                      NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based
                      on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
                      object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
                      object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
                      it never skips the policy.

                      For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
                      associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
                      follows:
                      "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "runlevel",
                            "operator": "NotIn",
                            "values": [
                              "0",
                              "1"
                            ]
                          }
                        ]
                      }

                      If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose
                      namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
                      you will set the selector as follows:
                      "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "environment",
                            "operator": "In",
                            "values": [
                              "prod",

                                    - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
                                    For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,

                                    - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
                                    For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,

                                    NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based
                                    on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
                                    object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
                                    object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
                                    it never skips the policy.

                                    For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
                                    associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
                                    follows:
                                    "namespaceSelector": {
                                      "matchExpressions": [

                                          ]
                                        }
                                      ]
                                    }

                                    If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose
                                    namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
                                    you will set the selector as follows:

                                      messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a validation, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails.

                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and
                                      the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the `expression` except for 'authorizer' and 'authorizer.requestResource'.

                                  that is used for composition. A variable is defined
                                  as a named expression.

                                      Expression is the expression that will be evaluated as the value of the variable.

                                      Name is the name of the variable. The name must be a valid CEL identifier and unique among all variables.
                                      The variable can be accessed in other expressions through `variables`
                                      For example, if name is "foo", the variable will be available as `variables.foo`
