## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Thanos](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/thanos) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/thanos
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

These commands deploy Thanos on the Kubernetes cluster with the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration-and-installation-details) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Architecture

This charts allows you install several Thanos components, so you deploy an architecture as the one below:

> Note: Components marked with (*) are provided by subchart(s) (such as the [Bitnami MinIO&reg; chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/minio)) or external charts (such as the [Bitnami kube-prometheus chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus)).

Check the section [Integrate Thanos with Prometheus and Alertmanager](#integrate-thanos-with-prometheus-and-alertmanager) for detailed instructions to deploy this architecture.

## Configuration and installation details

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcePreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Adding extra flags

In case you want to add extra flags to any Thanos component, you can use `XXX.extraFlags` parameter(s), where XXX is placeholder you need to replace with the actual component(s). For instance, to add extra flags to Thanos Store Gateway, use:

```yaml
storegateway:
  extraFlags:
    - --sync-block-duration=3m
    - --chunk-pool-size=2GB
```

This also works for multi-line flags. This can be useful when you want to configure caching for a particular component without using a configMap. For example, to configure the [query-range response cache of the Thanos Query Frontend](https://thanos.io/tip/components/query-frontend.md/#memcached), use:

```yaml
queryFrontend:
  extraFlags:
    - |
      --query-range.response-cache-config=
      type: MEMCACHED
      config:
        addresses:
          - <MEMCACHED_SERVER>:11211
        timeout: 500ms
        max_idle_connections: 100
        max_async_concurrency: 10
        max_async_buffer_size: 10000
        max_get_multi_concurrency: 100
        max_get_multi_batch_size: 0
        dns_provider_update_interval: 10s
        expiration: 24h
```

### Using custom Objstore configuration

This helm chart supports using custom Objstore configuration.

You can specify the Objstore configuration using the `objstoreConfig` parameter.

In addition, you can also set an external Secret with the configuration file. This is done by setting the `existingObjstoreSecret` parameter. Note that this will override the previous option. If needed you can also provide a custom Secret Key with `existingObjstoreSecretItems`, please be aware that the Path of your Secret should be `objstore.yml`.

### Using custom Query Service Discovery configuration

This helm chart supports using custom Service Discovery configuration for Query.

You can specify the Service Discovery configuration using the `query.sdConfig` parameter.

In addition, you can also set an external ConfigMap with the Service Discovery configuration file. This is done by setting the `query.existingSDConfigmap` parameter. Note that this will override the previous option.

### Using custom Ruler configuration

This helm chart supports using custom Ruler configuration.

You can specify the Ruler configuration using the `ruler.config` parameter.

In addition, you can also set an external ConfigMap with the configuration file. This is done by setting the `ruler.existingConfigmap` parameter. Note that this will override the previous option.

### Running Thanos with HTTPS and basic authentication

This helm charts supports using HTTPS and basic authentication. The underlying feature is experimental and might change in the future, so are the associated settings in the chart.
For more information, please refer to [Thanos documentation](https://thanos.io/tip/operating/https.md/#running-thanos-with-https-and-basic-authentication).

This feature can be enabled by using the following values:

- `https.enabled=true`. Enabling HTTPS requires the user to provide the TLS certificate and Key for Thanos, which can be done using one of the following options:

  - Provide a secret using `https.existingSecret`. The secret must contain the keys `tls.crt` or `tls.key` (key names can be renamed using the values `https.keyFilename` and `https.certFilename`).
  - Provide the certificate and key in your values.yaml under the values `https.cert` and `https.key`.
  - Use `https.autoGenerated=true`, using this value Helm will generate a self-signed key pair during the chart initialization. Not recommended for production environments.

- `auth.basicAuthUsers.*`. An dictionary of key / values, where the keys corresponds to the users that will have access to Thanos and the values are the plaintext passwords. Passwords will be later encrypted with bcrypt.
- Alternatively, provide your own Thanos http config file using the value `httpConfig` or `existingHttpConfigSecret`. This may cause any settings under `https.*` or `auth.*` to be ignored, except for the settings related to the TLS certificates. When providing a configuration file using these parameters, the chart Probes will fail to initialize unless one of the following fixes are applied:
  - Set `https.enabled` or `auth.basicAuthUsers` with at least one user, matching the configuration file you provided. That way Probes will be configured with HTTPS and/or basic authentication accordingly.
  - Configure your own Probes using `<component>.customLivenessProbe`, `<component>.customReadinessProbe` and `<component>.customStartupProbe`.
  - **Not recommended**. Disable the Probes.

### Store time partitions

Thanos store supports partion based on time.

Setting time partitions will create N number of store statefulsets based on the number of items in the `timePartitioning` list. Each item must contain the min and max time for querying in the supported format (find more details at [Thanos documentation](https://thanos.io/tip/components/store.md/#time-based-partitioning)).

> Note: leaving the `timePartitioning` list empty (`[]`) will create a single store for all data.

For instance, to use 3 stores you can use a **values.yaml** like the one below:

```yaml
timePartitioning:
  # One store for data older than 6 weeks
  - min: ""
    max: -6w
  # One store for data newer than 6 weeks and older than 2 weeks
  - min: -6w
    max: -2w
  # One store for data newer than 2 weeks
  - min: -2w
    max: ""
```

You can also specify different resources and limits configurations for each storegateway statefulset. This is done by adding a `resources.requests` and `resources.limits` to each item you wish to change, as shown below:

```yaml
timePartitioning:
  # One store for data older than 6 weeks
  - min: ""
    max: -6w
  # One store for data newer than 6 weeks and older than 2 weeks
  - min: -6w
    max: -2w
    resources: #optional resources declaration for partition
      requests:
        cpu: 10m
        memory: 100Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 20m
        memory: 100Mi
  # One store for data newer than 2 weeks
  - min: -2w
    max: ""
```

### Integrate Thanos with Prometheus and Alertmanager

You can integrate Thanos with Prometheus & Alertmanager using this chart and the [Bitnami kube-prometheus chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) following the steps below:

> Note: in this example we will use MinIO&reg; (subchart) as the Objstore. Every component will be deployed in the "monitoring" namespace.

- Create a **values.yaml** like the one below:

```yaml
objstoreConfig: |-
  type: s3
  config:
    bucket: thanos
    endpoint: {{ include "thanos.minio.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:9000
    access_key: minio
    secret_key: minio123
    insecure: true
query:
  dnsDiscovery:
    sidecarsService: kube-prometheus-prometheus-thanos
    sidecarsNamespace: monitoring
bucketweb:
  enabled: true
compactor:
  enabled: true
storegateway:
  enabled: true
ruler:
  enabled: true
  alertmanagers:
    - http://kube-prometheus-alertmanager.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9093
  config: |-
    groups:
      - name: "metamonitoring"
        rules:
          - alert: "PrometheusDown"
            expr: absent(up{prometheus="monitoring/kube-prometheus"})
metrics:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
minio:
  enabled: true
  auth:
    rootPassword: minio123
    rootUser: minio
  monitoringBuckets: thanos
  accessKey:
    password: minio
  secretKey:
    password: minio123
```

- Install Prometheus Operator and Thanos charts:

For Helm 3:

```console
$ kubectl create namespace monitoring
helm install kube-prometheus \
    --set prometheus.thanos.create=true \
    --namespace monitoring \
    bitnami/kube-prometheus
helm install thanos \
    --values values.yaml \
    --namespace monitoring \
    oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/thanos
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

That's all! Now you have Thanos fully integrated with Prometheus and Alertmanager.

### Deploy extra resources

There are cases where you may want to deploy extra objects, such a ConfigMap containing your app's configuration or some extra deployment with a micro service used by your app. For covering this case, the chart allows adding the full specification of other objects using the `extraDeploy` parameter.

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `XXX.affinity` parameter(s). Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `XXX.podAffinityPreset`, `XXX.podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `XXX.nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

## Persistence

The data is persisted by default using PVC(s) on Thanos components. You can disable the persistence setting the `XXX.persistence.enabled` parameter(s) to `false`. A default `StorageClass` is needed in the Kubernetes cluster to dynamically provision the volumes. Specify another StorageClass in the `XXX.persistence.storageClass` parameter(s) or set `XXX.persistence.existingClaim` if you have already existing persistent volumes to use.

> Note: you need to substitute the XXX placeholders above with the actual component(s) you want to configure.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the images run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volumes so that the containers can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volumes. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volumes before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release --set query.replicaCount=2 oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/thanos
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The above command install Thanos chart with 2 Thanos Query replicas.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/thanos
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/thanos/values.yaml)

## Upgrading

### To 15.0.0

This major bump changes the following security defaults:

- `resourcesPreset` is changed from `none` to the minimum size working in our test suites (NOTE: `resourcesPreset` is not meant for production usage, but `resources` adapted to your use case).
- `global.compatibility.openshift.adaptSecurityContext` is changed from `disabled` to `auto`.

This could potentially break any customization or init scripts used in your deployment. If this is the case, change the default values to the previous ones.

### To 14.0.0

This major release bumps the MinIO chart version to [13.x.x](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/pull/22058/); no major issues are expected during the upgrade.

### To 13.0.0

This major version changes the NetworkPolicy objects and creates one per Thanos component. The `networkPolicy` common value was removed in favor of `COMPONENT.networkPolicy`. Also, NetworkPolicy objects are deployed by default. This can be changed by setting `COMPONENT.networkPolicy.enabled=false` being `COMPONENT` one of the Thanos components.

This version also removes deprecated service port values like `receive.service.http.port` in favor of `recieve.service.ports.http`, as well as `existingServiceAccount`.

### To 12.0.0

This major updates the MinIO&reg; subchart to its newest major, 12.0.0. This subchart's major doesn't include any changes affecting its use as a subchart for Thanos, so no major issues are expected during the upgrade.

### To 10.0.0

This version deprecates the usage of `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` environment variables in MINIO&reg; container in favor of `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

If you were already using the new variables, no issues are expected during upgrade.

### To 9.0.0

This major updates the MinIO&reg; subchart to its newest major, 10.0.0. This subchart's major doesn't include any changes affecting its use as a subchart for Thanos, only needing the standard upgrade process from chart's version `8.X`.

### To 8.0.0

The chart was changed to adapt to the common Bitnami chart standards. Now it includes common elements such as sidecar and init container support, custom commands, custom liveness/readiness probes, extra environment variables support, extra pod annotations and labels, among others. In addition, other remarkable changes were to harmonize the values structure:

- The `receive.distributor.*` parameters have been renamed to `receiveDistributor.*`, and the associated manifests have been moved into its own folder. This way, Thanos Receive Distributor is treated as any other component.
- The parameter to configure TLS in the GRPC server have been restructured so they follow the `XXX.grpc.server.tls` and `XXX.grpc.client.tls` format. Previous to this change, we had different structures depending on the component.

### To 7.0.0

This major updates the MinIO&reg; subchart to its newest major, 9.0.0, which updates authentication parameters. Check [MinIO&reg; Upgrading Notes](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/minio#to-900) for more information.
This major release renames several values in this chart and adds missing features, in order to be inline with the rest of assets in the Bitnami charts repositor. Some of the affected values are:

- `XXX.extraEnv` parameters were renamed to `XXX.extraEnvVars`.
- `XXX.extraContainers` parameters were renamed to `XXX.sidecars`.
- `XXX.service.PROTOCOL.port` parameters were renamed to `XXX.service.ports.PROTOCOL` (e.g. `query.service.http.port` is now `query.service.ports.http`).
- `XXX.service.PROTOCOL.nodePort`parameters were renamed to `XXX.service.nodePorts.PROTOCOL` (e.g. `query.service.http.nodePort` is now `query.service.nodePorts.http`).
- `XXX.ingress.certManager` parameters were deprecated, use `XXX.ingress.annotations` to set the required annotations for CertManager instead.

### To 6.0.0

This major updates the MinIO&reg; subchart to its newest major, 8.0.0, which now has two separated services for MinIO&reg; Console and MinIO&reg; API. Check [MinIO&reg; Upgrading Notes](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/minio#to-800) for more information.

### To 5.4.0

This version introduces support for the receiver dual-mode implementation for Thanos [v0.22+](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.22.0)

### To 5.3.0

This version introduces hash and time partitioning for the store gateway.

### To 5.0.0

This major update changes the `securityContext` interface in the `values.yaml` file.

Please note if you have changes in the `securityContext` fields those need to be migrated to `podSecurityContext`.

```diff
# ...
- securityContext:
+ podSecurityContext:
# ...
```

Other than that a new `securityContext` interface for containers got introduced `containerSecurityContext`. It's default is enabled so if you do not need it you need to opt out of it.

```diff
# ...
+ containerSecurityContext
+   enabled: true  # opt out by enabled: false
+   capabilities:
+     drop:
+     - ALL
+   runAsNonRoot: true
+   allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
+   readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
# ...
```

### To 4.0.0

This major updates the MinIO subchart to its newest major, 7.0.0, which removes previous configuration of `securityContext` and moves to `podSecurityContext` and `containerSecurityContext`.

### To 3.3.0

This version introduces `bitnami/common`, a [library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/#helm) as a dependency. More documentation about this new utility could be found [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#bitnami-common-library-chart). Please, make sure that you have updated the chart dependencies before executing any upgrade.

### To 3.1.0

The querier component and its settings have been renamed to query. Configuration of the query component by using keys under `querier` in your `values.yaml` will continue to work. Support for keys under `querier` will be dropped in a future release.

### To 3.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

### To 2.4.0

The Ingress API object name for Querier changes from `{{ include "common.names.fullname" . }}` to `{{ include "common.names.fullname" . }}-querier`.

> **NOTE**: Which in most cases (depending on any set values in `fullnameOverride` or `nameOverride`) resolves to the used Helm release name (`.Release.Name`).

### To 2.0.0

The format of the chart's `extraFlags` option has been updated to be an array (instead of an object), to support passing multiple flags with the same name to Thanos.

Now you need to specify the flags in the following way in your values file (where component is one of `querier/bucketweb/compactor/storegateway/ruler`):

```yaml
component:
  ...
  extraFlags
    - --sync-block-duration=3m
    - --chunk-pool-size=2GB
```

To specify the values via CLI::

```console
--set 'component.extraFlags[0]=--sync-block-duration=3m' --set 'ruler.extraFlags[1]=--chunk-pool-size=2GB'
```

### To 1.0.0

If you are upgrading from a `<1.0.0` release you need to move your Querier Ingress information to the new values settings:

```text
ingress.enabled -> querier.ingress.enabled
ingress.certManager -> querier.ingress.certManager
ingress.hostname -> querier.ingress.hostname
ingress.annotations -> querier.ingress.annotations
ingress.extraHosts[0].name -> querier.ingress.extraHosts[0].name
ingress.extraHosts[0].path -> querier.ingress.extraHosts[0].path
ingress.extraHosts[0].hosts[0] -> querier.ingress.extraHosts[0].hosts[0]
ingress.extraHosts[0].secretName -> querier.ingress.extraHosts[0].secretName
ingress.secrets[0].name -> querier.ingress.secrets[0].name
ingress.secrets[0].certificate -> querier.ingress.secrets[0].certificate
ingress.secrets[0].key -> querier.ingress.secrets[0].key
```
