## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [victoriametrics](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/victoriametrics-vmselect) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/victoriametrics
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The command deploys victoriametrics on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### Available VictoriaMetrics components

The VictoriaMetrics chart always deploys the `vminsert`, `vmstorage` and `vmselect` components, as part of the basic [open-source VictoriaMetrics cluster installation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/). Additionally, it is possible to deploy the [`vmauth`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/), [`vmalert`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/) or [`vmagent`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) components by setting `vmauth.enabled=true`, `vmagent.enabled=true` or `vmalert.enabled=true`.

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcesPreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Backup and restore

To back up and restore Helm chart deployments on Kubernetes, you need to back up the persistent volumes from the source deployment and attach them to a new deployment using [Velero](https://velero.io/), a Kubernetes backup/restore tool. Find the instructions for using Velero in [this guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-backup-restore-deployments-velero-index.html).

### Prometheus metrics

This chart can be integrated with Prometheus by setting `*.metrics.enabled` (under the `vminsert`, `vmselect`, `vmstorage`, `vmagent`, `vmalert` and `vmauth` sections) to `true`. This will expose victoriametrics native Prometheus ports in the containers. Additionally, it will deploy several `metrics` services, which can be configured under the `*.metrics.service` section (under the `vminsert`, `vmselect`, `vmstorage`, `vmagent`, `vmalert` and `vmauth` sections). These `metrics` services will have the necessary annotations to be automatically scraped by Prometheus.

#### Prometheus requirements

It is necessary to have a working installation of Prometheus or Prometheus Operator for the integration to work. Install the [Bitnami Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/prometheus) or the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) to easily have a working Prometheus in your cluster.

#### Integration with Prometheus Operator

The chart can deploy `ServiceMonitor` objects for integration with Prometheus Operator installations. To do so, set the value `*.metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true`  (`vminsert`, `vmselect`, `vmstorage`, `vmagent`, `vmalert` and `vmauth`). Ensure that the Prometheus Operator `CustomResourceDefinitions` are installed in the cluster or it will fail with the following error:

```text
no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
```

Install the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) for having the necessary CRDs and the Prometheus Operator.

### Ingress

This chart provides support for Ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress-controller](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller) or [contour](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/contour) you can utilize the ingress controller to serve your application.To enable Ingress integration, set `*.ingress.enabled` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) to `true`.

The most common scenario is to have one host name mapped to the deployment. In this case, the `*.ingress.hostname` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) property can be used to set the host name. The `*.ingress.tls` parameter can be used to add the TLS configuration for this host.

However, it is also possible to have more than one host. To facilitate this, the `*.ingress.extraHosts` parameter (if available) can be set with the host names specified as an array. The `*.ingress.extraTLS` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) parameter (if available) can also be used to add the TLS configuration for extra hosts.

> NOTE: For each host specified in the `*.ingress.extraHosts` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) parameter, it is necessary to set a name, path, and any annotations that the Ingress controller should know about. Not all annotations are supported by all Ingress controllers, but [this annotation reference document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md) lists the annotations supported by many popular Ingress controllers.

Adding the TLS parameter (where available) will cause the chart to generate HTTPS URLs, and the  application will be available on port 443. The actual TLS secrets do not have to be generated by this chart. However, if TLS is enabled, the Ingress record will not work until the TLS secret exists.

[Learn more about Ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).

### Securing traffic using TLS

This chart facilitates the creation of TLS secrets for use with the Ingress controller (although this is not mandatory). There are several common use cases:

- Generate certificate secrets based on chart parameters.
- Enable externally generated certificates.
- Manage application certificates via an external service (like [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/)).
- Create self-signed certificates within the chart (if supported).

In the first two cases, a certificate and a key are needed. Files are expected in `.pem` format.

Here is an example of a certificate file:

> NOTE: There may be more than one certificate if there is a certificate chain.

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID6TCCAtGgAwIBAgIJAIaCwivkeB5EMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFYxCzAJBgNV
...
jScrvkiBO65F46KioCL9h5tDvomdU1aqpI/CBzhvZn1c0ZTf87tGQR8NK7v7
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Here is an example of a certificate key:

```text
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvLYcyu8f3skuRyUgeeNpeDvYBCDcgq+LsWap6zbX5f8oLqp4
...
wrj2wDbCDCFmfqnSJ+dKI3vFLlEz44sAV8jX/kd4Y6ZTQhlLbYc=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

- If using Helm to manage the certificates based on the parameters, copy these values into the `certificate` and `key` values for a given `*.ingress.secrets` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) entry.
- If managing TLS secrets separately, it is necessary to create a TLS secret with name `INGRESS_HOSTNAME-tls` (where INGRESS_HOSTNAME is a placeholder to be replaced with the hostname you set using the `*.ingress.hostname` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) parameter).
- If your cluster has a [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates, add to `*.ingress.annotations` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) the [corresponding ones](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/#supported-annotations) for cert-manager.
- If using self-signed certificates created by Helm, set both `*.ingress.tls` and `*.ingress.selfSigned` (under the `vmselect`, `vmauth` and `vmselect` sections) to `true`.
