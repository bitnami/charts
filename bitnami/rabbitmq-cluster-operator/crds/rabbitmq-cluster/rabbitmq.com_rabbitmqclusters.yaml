                    DelayStartSeconds is the time the init container (`setup-container`) will sleep before terminating.
                    This effectively delays the time between starting the Pod and starting the `rabbitmq` container.
                    RabbitMQ relies on up-to-date DNS entries early during peer discovery.
                    The purpose of this artificial delay is to ensure that DNS entries are up-to-date when booting RabbitMQ.
