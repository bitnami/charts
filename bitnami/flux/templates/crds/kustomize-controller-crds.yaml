                         first address in the cluster resource will be used, and if

                      SecretRef holds an optional name of a secret that contains a key with
                      the kubeconfig file as the value. If no key is set, the key will default
                      to 'value'. Mutually exclusive with ConfigMapRef.
                      It is recommended that the kubeconfig is self-contained, and the secret
                      is regularly updated if credentials such as a cloud-access-token expire.

                      binaries and credentials to the Pod that is responsible for reconciling
                      Kubernetes resources. Supported only for the generic provider.
