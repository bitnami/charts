                                            PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an

                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                            PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an

                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                              recursively.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                              supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                              If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                              None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                  for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as

                                  When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for

                                  containers as root without actually having root privileges on the host.

                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                              RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                              recursively.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                              supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                              If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                              None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.

                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.

                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards

                                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.
                                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                            Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                            Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                          pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                          be one of the following values:
                                          * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                          * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                            done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                            list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                            match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                            request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                            of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                            matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                          * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                            the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                            or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                          Implementations are required to support all path types.

                          of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                          traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                          be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                          routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                          features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                          within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                          a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                          to SingleStack. Services can be "SingleStack" (a single IP family),
                          "PreferDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or
                          a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or "RequireDualStack"
                          (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The
                          ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. This

                          but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer
                          implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
                          implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.
                          This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.
                          Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.

                          The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                          through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                          "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                          routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                          "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                          (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                          as the clusterIP.

                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.
