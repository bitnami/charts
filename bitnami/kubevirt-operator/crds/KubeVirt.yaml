                      the overhead calculated by Kubevirt. A higher ratio means that the VMs would be less compromised
                      by node pressures, but would mean that fewer VMs could be scheduled to a node.

                          For each requested virtual CPU, CPUAllocationRatio defines how much physical CPU to request per VMI
                          from the hosting node. The value is in fraction of a CPU thread (or core on non-hyperthreaded nodes).
                          For example, a value of 1 means 1 physical CPU thread per VMI CPU thread.

                                            for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                            Also, matchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                                Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                                of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                                If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                                            MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                            be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with 'labelSelector' as 'key notin (value)'
                                            to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                            for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                            Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                            This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).
