# Bitnami package for Harbor

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud-native registry to store, sign, and scan content. It adds functionalities like security, identity, and management to the open source Docker distribution.

[Overview of Harbor](https://goharbor.io/)

## TL;DR

```console
helm install my-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/harbor
```

## Introduction

This [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) chart installs [Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) in a Kubernetes cluster. Welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to Helm Chart for Harbor.

This Helm chart has been developed based on [goharbor/harbor-helm](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-helm) chart but including some features common to the Bitnami chart library.
For example, the following changes have been introduced:

- Possibility to pull all the required images from a private registry through the  Global Docker image parameters.
- Redis&reg; and PostgreSQL are managed as chart dependencies.
- Liveness and Readiness probes for all deployments are exposed to the values.yaml.
- Uses new Helm chart labels formatting.
- Uses Bitnami container images:
  - non-root by default
  - published for debian-10 and ol-7
- This chart support the Harbor optional components.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/harbor
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

## Configuration and installation details

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcePreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Catalog/services/tutorials/GUID-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Configure the way how to expose Harbor core

You can expose Harbor core using two methods:

- An Ingress Controller, `exposureType` should be set to `ingress`.
  - An ingress controller must be installed in the Kubernetes cluster.
  - If the TLS is disabled, the port must be included in the command when pulling/pushing images. Refer to issue [#5291](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/5291) for the detail.
- An NGINX Proxy, `exposureType` should be set to `proxy`. There are three ways to do so depending on the NGINX Proxy service type:
  - **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster:
  - **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). You'll be able to contact the NodePort service, from outside the cluster, by requesting `NodeIP:NodePort`.
  - **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.

### Configure the external URL

The external URL for Harbor core service is used to:

1. populate the docker/helm commands showed on portal

Format: `protocol://domain[:port]`. Usually:

- if expose Harbor core service via Ingress, the `domain` should be the value of `ingress.core.hostname`.
- if expose Harbor core via NGINX proxy using a `ClusterIP` service type, the `domain` should be the value of `service.clusterIP`.
- if expose Harbor core via NGINX proxy using a `NodePort` service type, the `domain` should be the IP address of one Kubernetes node.
- if expose Harbor core via NGINX proxy using a `LoadBalancer` service type, set the `domain` as your own domain name and add a CNAME record to map the domain name to the one you got from the cloud provider.

If Harbor is deployed behind the proxy, set it as the URL of proxy.

### Sidecars and Init Containers

If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as any of the Harbor components (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the `sidecars` config parameter inside each component subsection. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

```yaml
core:
  sidecars:
    - name: your-image-name
      image: your-image
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      ports:
        - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

Similarly, you can add extra init containers using the `initContainers` parameter.

```yaml
core:
  initContainers:
    - name: your-image-name
      image: your-image
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      ports:
        - name: portname
          containerPort: 1234
```

### Adding extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property inside each component subsection.

```yaml
core:
  extraEnvVars:
    - name: LOG_LEVEL
      value: error
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values inside each component subsection.

### Configure data persistence

- **Disable**: The data does not survive the termination of a pod.
- **Persistent Volume Claim(default)**: A default `StorageClass` is needed in the Kubernetes cluster to dynamically provision the volumes. Specify another StorageClass in the `storageClass` or set `existingClaim` if you have already existing persistent volumes to use.
- **External Storage(only for images and charts)**: For images and charts, the external storages are supported: `azure`, `gcs`, `s3` `swift` and `oss`.

### Configure the secrets

- **Secrets**: Secrets are used for encryption and to secure communication between components. Fill `core.secret`, `jobservice.secret` and `registry.secret` to configure then statically through the helm values. it expects the "key or password", not the secret name where secrets are stored.
- **Certificates**: Used for token encryption/decryption. Fill `core.secretName` to configure.

Secrets and certificates must be setup to avoid changes on every Helm upgrade (see: [#107](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-helm/issues/107)).

If you want to manage full Secret objects by your own, you can use existingSecret & existingEnvVarsSecret parameters. This could be useful for some secure GitOps workflows, of course, you will have to ensure to define all expected keys for those secrets.

The core service have two `Secret` objects, the default one for data & communication which is very important as it's contains the data encryption key of your harbor instance ! and a second one which contains standard passwords, database access password, ...
Keep in mind that the `HARBOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is only used to boostrap your harbor instance, if you update it after the deployment, the password is updated in database, but the secret will remain the initial one.

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `XXX.affinity` parameter(s). Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `XXX.podAffinityPreset`, `XXX.podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `XXX.nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the images run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volumes so that the containers can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

| `metrics.path`                             | Path where metrics are exposed                                                                    | `/metrics` |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled`           | if `true`, creates a Prometheus Operator ServiceMonitor (requires `metrics.enabled` to be `true`) | `false`    |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.namespace`         | Namespace in which Prometheus is running                                                          | `""`       |

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set adminPassword=password \
    oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/harbor
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The above command sets the Harbor administrator account password to `password`.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/harbor
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

## Upgrading

### To 21.0.0

This major bump changes the following security defaults:

- `runAsGroup` is changed from `0` to `1001`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is set to `true`
- `resourcesPreset` is changed from `none` to the minimum size working in our test suites (NOTE: `resourcesPreset` is not meant for production usage, but `resources` adapted to your use case).
- `global.compatibility.openshift.adaptSecurityContext` is changed from `disabled` to `auto`.

This could potentially break any customization or init scripts used in your deployment. If this is the case, change the default values to the previous ones.

### To 20.0.0

This major release bumps the PostgreSQL chart version to [14.x.x](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/pull/22750); no major issues are expected during the upgrade.

### To 19.0.0

This major updates the PostgreSQL subchart to its newest major, 13.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql#to-1300) you can find more information about the changes introduced in that version.

### To 18.0.0

This major deprecates harbor notary server and harbor notary signer components. These components were deprecated in Harbor 2.9.0, find more information in [Harbor wiki](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Harbor-Deprecates-Notary-v1-Support-in-v2.9.0).

### To 17.0.0

This major updates the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 18.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#to-1800) you can find more information about the changes introduced in that version.

NOTE: Due to an error in our release process, Redis&reg;' chart versions higher or equal than 17.15.4 already use Redis&reg; 7.2 by default.

### To 16.0.0

This major updates the PostgreSQL subchart to its newest major, 12.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql#to-1200) you can find more information about the changes introduced in that version.

### To 15.0.0

This major update the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 17.0.0, which updates Redis&reg; from its version 6.2 to the latest 7.0.

### To 14.x.x

The new version of this chart is not longer sopported Clair, who was deprecated by Habor in the [version 2.2.0](https://goharbor.io/blog/harbor-2.2/)

### To 13.x.x

This major release updates the PostgreSQL subchart image to the newest 13.x version.

#### Upgrading Instructions

The upgrade process to *13.x.x* from *12.x.x* should be done by reusing the PVC(s) used to hold the data on your previous release. To do so, follow the instructions below (the following example assumes that the release name is `harbor`):

> NOTE: Please, create a backup of your database before running any of these actions.

1. Select the namespace where Harbor is deployed:

```console
HARBOR_NAMESPACE='default'
```

1. Obtain the credentials and the names of the PVCs used to hold the data on your current release:

```console
HARBOR_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" harbor-core-envvars -o jsonpath="{.data.HARBOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD}" | base64 --decode)
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" harbor-postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.postgresql-password}" | base64 --decode)
POSTGRESQL_PVC=$(kubectl get pvc --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=harbor,app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql,role=primary -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```

1. Delete the PostgreSQL statefulset (notice the option `--cascade=orphan`) and secret:

```console
kubectl delete statefulsets.apps --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" --cascade=orphan harbor-postgresql
kubectl delete secret --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" harbor-postgresql
```

1. Upgrade your release using the same PostgreSQL version:

```console
CURRENT_PG_VERSION=$(kubectl exec --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" harbor-postgresql-0 -c harbor-postgresql -- bash -c 'printenv APP_VERSION')
helm --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" upgrade harbor bitnami/harbor \
  --set adminPassword="${HARBOR_PASSWORD:?}" \
  --set postgresql.image.tag="${CURRENT_PG_VERSION:?}" \
  --set postgresql.auth.postgresPassword="${POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD:?}" \
  --set postgresql.primary.persistence.existingClaim="${POSTGRESQL_PVC:?}"
```

1. Delete the existing PostgreSQL pods and the new statefulset will create a new one:

```console
kubectl delete pod --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" harbor-postgresql-0
```

### To 12.x.x

This major release renames several values in this chart and adds missing features, in order to be inline with the rest of assets in the Bitnami charts repository. Additionally updates the PostgreSQL & Redis subcharts to their newest major 11.x.x and 16.x.x, respectively, which contain similar changes.

- `harborAdminPassword` was renamed to `adminPassword`
- `forcePassword` was deprecated
- Traffic exposure was completely redesigned:
  - The new parameter `exposureType` allows deciding whether to expose Harbor using Ingress or an NGINX proxy
  - `service.type` doesn't accept `Ingress` as a valid value anymore. To configure traffic exposure through Ingress, set `exposureType` to `ingress`
  - `service.tls` map has been renamed to `nginx.tls`
  - To configure TLS termination with Ingress, set the `ingress.core.tls` parameter
  - `ingress` map is completely redefined
- `xxxImage` parameters (e.g. `nginxImage`) have been renamed to `xxx.image` (e.g. `nginx.image`)
- `xxx.replicas` parameters (e.g. `nginx.replicas`) have been renamed to `xxx.replicaCount` (e.g. `nginx.replicaCount`)
- `persistence.persistentVolumeClaim.xxx.accessMode` parameters (e.g. `persistence.persistentVolumeClaim.registry.accessMode`) have been renamed to `persistence.persistentVolumeClaim.xxx.accessModes` (e.g. `persistence.persistentVolumeClaim.registry.accessModes`) and expect an array instead of a string
- `caBundleSecretName` was renamed to `internalTLS.caBundleSecret`
- `persistence.imageChartStorage.caBundleSecretName` was renamed to `persistence.imageChartStorage.caBundleSecret`
- `core.uaaSecretName` was renamed to `core.uaaSecret`

#### How to upgrade to version 12.0.0

To upgrade to *12.x.x* from *11.x*, it should be done reusing the PVC(s) used to hold the data on your previous release. To do so, follow the instructions below (the following example assumes that the release name is `harbor`):

  --set postgresql.auth.postgresPassword="${POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD:?}" \
  --set postgresql.primary.persistence.existingClaim="${POSTGRESQL_PVC:?}"
```

1. Delete the existing PostgreSQL pods and the new statefulset will create a new one:

```console
kubectl delete pod --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" harbor-postgresql-0
```

> **NOTE:** the instructions above reuse the same PostgreSQL version you were using in your chart release. Otherwise, you will find an error such as the one below when upgrading since the new chart major version also bumps the application version. To workaround this issue you need to upgrade database, please refer to the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html) for more information about this.

> $ kubectl --namespace "${HARBOR_NAMESPACE:?}" logs harbor-postgresql-0 --container harbor-postgresql

### To 11.0.0

This major update the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 15.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#to-1500) you can find more info about the specific changes.

### To 10.0.0

This major updates the Redis&reg; subchart to it newest major, 14.0.0, which contains breaking changes. For more information on this subchart's major and the steps needed to migrate your data from your previous release, please refer to [Redis&reg; upgrade notes.](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#to-1400).

### To 9.7.0

This new version of the chart bumps the version of Harbor to [`2.2.0`](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.2.0) which deprecates built-in Clair. If you still want to use Clair, you will need to set `clair.enabled` to `true` and Clair scanner and the Harbor adapter will be deployed. Follow [these steps](https://goharbor.io/docs/latest/administration/vulnerability-scanning/pluggable-scanners) to add it as an additional interrogation service for Harbor.

Please note that Clair might be fully deprecated from this chart in following updates.

### To 9.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

- Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
- Move dependency information from the *requirements.yaml* to the *Chart.yaml*
- After running *helm dependency update*, a *Chart.lock* file is generated containing the same structure used in the previous *requirements.lock*
- The different fields present in the *Chart.yaml* file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Chart.
- This chart depends on the **PostgreSQL 10** instead of **PostgreSQL 9**. Apart from the same changes that are described in this section, there are also other major changes due to the master/slave nomenclature was replaced by primary/readReplica. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/pull/4385) you can find more information about the changes introduced.

#### Considerations when upgrading to this version

- If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm v2, this scenario is not supported as this version does not support Helm v2 anymore.
- If you installed the previous version with Helm v2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm v3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm v2 to v3.

#### How to upgrade to version 9.0.0

To upgrade to *9.0.0* from *8.x*, it should be done reusing the PVC(s) used to hold the data on your previous release. To do so, follow the instructions below (the following example assumes that the release name is `harbor` and the release namespace `default`):

> NOTE: Please, create a backup of your database before running any of those actions.

1. Obtain the credentials and the names of the PVCs used to hold the data on your current release:

```console
export HARBOR_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default harbor-core-envvars -o jsonpath="{.data.HARBOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD}" | base64 --decode)
export POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default harbor-postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.postgresql-password}" | base64 --decode)
export POSTGRESQL_PVC=$(kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=harbor,app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql,role=master -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```

1. Delete the PostgreSQL statefulset (notice the option *--cascade=false*)

```console
kubectl delete statefulsets.apps --cascade=false harbor-postgresql
```

1. Upgrade your release:

```console
helm upgrade harbor bitnami/harbor \
  --set harborAdminPassword=$HARBOR_PASSWORD \
  --set postgresql.image.tag=$CURRENT_PG_VERSION \
  --set postgresql.postgresqlPassword$POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD \
  --set postgresql.persistence.existingClaim=$POSTGRESQL_PVC
```

1. Delete the existing PostgreSQL pods and the new statefulset will create a new one:

```console
kubectl delete pod harbor-postgresql-0
```
