          and it is applied to Kong Upstream objects created by the controller. \n
          It can be attached to Services. To attach it to a Service, it has to be
          annotated with `konghq.com/upstream-policy: <name>`, where `<name>` is the
          name of the KongUpstreamPolicy object in the same namespace as the Service.
          \n When attached to a Service, it will affect all Kong Upstreams created
          for the Service. \n When attached to a Service used in a Gateway API *Route
          rule with multiple BackendRefs, all of its Services MUST be configured with
          the same KongUpstreamPolicy. Otherwise, the controller will *ignore* the
          KongUpstreamPolicy. \n Note: KongUpstreamPolicy doesn't implement Gateway
          API's GEP-713 strictly. In particular, it doesn't use the TargetRef for
          attaching to Services and Gateway API *Routes - annotations are used instead.
          This is to allow reusing the same KongUpstreamPolicy for multiple Services
          and Gateway API *Routes."
