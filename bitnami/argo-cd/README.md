## Introduction

This chart bootstraps an Argo CD deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/argo-cd
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The command deploys argo-cd on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Configuration and installation details

### Resource requests and limits

Bitnami charts allow setting resource requests and limits for all containers inside the chart deployment. These are inside the `resources` value (check parameter table). Setting requests is essential for production workloads and these should be adapted to your specific use case.

To make this process easier, the chart contains the `resourcesPreset` values, which automatically sets the `resources` section according to different presets. Check these presets in [the bitnami/common chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/common/templates/_resources.tpl#L15). However, in production workloads using `resourcesPreset` is discouraged as it may not fully adapt to your specific needs. Find more information on container resource management in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Prometheus metrics

This chart can be integrated with Prometheus by setting `*.metrics.enabled` (under the `repoServer`, `controller`, `applicationSet`, `server`, `notification` and `dex` sections) to `true`. This will expose the Argo CD native Prometheus ports, as well as create a special metrics service, which can be configured under the `metrics.service` section. This `metrics` service will have the necessary annotations to be automatically scraped by Prometheus.

#### Prometheus requirements

It is necessary to have a working installation of Prometheus or Prometheus Operator for the integration to work. Install the [Bitnami Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/prometheus) or the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) to easily have a working Prometheus in your cluster.

#### Integration with Prometheus Operator

The chart can deploy `ServiceMonitor` objects for integration with Prometheus Operator installations. To do so, set the value `*.metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled=true` (under the `repoServer`, `controller`, `applicationSet`, `server`, `notifications` and `dex` sections). Ensure that the Prometheus Operator `CustomResourceDefinitions` are installed in the cluster or it will fail with the following error:

```text
no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
```

Install the [Bitnami Kube Prometheus helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/kube-prometheus) for having the necessary CRDs and the Prometheus Operator.

### Backup and restore

To back up and restore Helm chart deployments on Kubernetes, you need to back up the persistent volumes from the source deployment and attach them to a new deployment using [Velero](https://velero.io/), a Kubernetes backup/restore tool. Find the instructions for using Velero in [this guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-backup-restore-deployments-velero-index.html).

### Ingress

This chart provides support for Ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress-controller](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller) or [contour](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/contour) you can utilize the ingress controller to serve your application.To enable Ingress integration, set `server.ingress.enabled` to `true` for the http ingress or `server.grpcIngress.enabled` to `true` for the gRPC ingress.

The most common scenario is to have one host name mapped to the deployment. In this case, the `xxx.ingress.hostname` property can be used to set the host name. The `xxx.ingress.tls` parameter can be used to add the TLS configuration for this host.

However, it is also possible to have more than one host. To facilitate this, the `xxx.ingress.extraHosts` parameter (if available) can be set with the host names specified as an array. The `xxx.ingress.extraTLS` parameter (if available) can also be used to add the TLS configuration for extra hosts.

> NOTE: For each host specified in the `xxx.ingress.extraHosts` parameter, it is necessary to set a name, path, and any annotations that the Ingress controller should know about. Not all annotations are supported by all Ingress controllers, but [this annotation reference document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md) lists the annotations supported by many popular Ingress controllers.

Adding the TLS parameter (where available) will cause the chart to generate HTTPS URLs, and the  application will be available on port 443. The actual TLS secrets do not have to be generated by this chart. However, if TLS is enabled, the Ingress record will not work until the TLS secret exists.

[Learn more about Ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).

### Securing traffic using TLS

This chart facilitates the creation of TLS secrets for use with the Ingress controller (although this is not mandatory). Apart from the Ingress TLS certificates, Argo CD repo server will auto-generate a secret named `argocd-repo-server-tls`. This secret contains the TLS configuration for the Argo CD components. The secret will be created only if it does not exist, so if you want to add custom TLS configuration you can create a secret with that name before installing the chart. There are several common use cases for the TLS secrets generation:

- Generate certificate secrets based on chart parameters.
- Enable externally generated certificates.
- Manage application certificates via an external service (like [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/)).
- Create self-signed certificates within the chart (if supported).

In the first two cases, a certificate and a key are needed. Files are expected in `.pem` format.

Here is an example of a certificate file:

> NOTE: There may be more than one certificate if there is a certificate chain.

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID6TCCAtGgAwIBAgIJAIaCwivkeB5EMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFYxCzAJBgNV
...
jScrvkiBO65F46KioCL9h5tDvomdU1aqpI/CBzhvZn1c0ZTf87tGQR8NK7v7
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Here is an example of a certificate key:

```text
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvLYcyu8f3skuRyUgeeNpeDvYBCDcgq+LsWap6zbX5f8oLqp4
...
wrj2wDbCDCFmfqnSJ+dKI3vFLlEz44sAV8jX/kd4Y6ZTQhlLbYc=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

- If using Helm to manage the certificates based on the parameters, copy these values into the `certificate` and `key` values for a given `*.ingress.secrets` entry.
- If managing TLS secrets separately, it is necessary to create a TLS secret with name `INGRESS_HOSTNAME-tls` (where INGRESS_HOSTNAME is a placeholder to be replaced with the hostname you set using the `*.ingress.hostname` parameter).
- If your cluster has a [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates, add to `*.ingress.annotations` the [corresponding ones](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/#supported-annotations) for cert-manager.
- If using self-signed certificates created by Helm, set both `*.ingress.tls` and `*.ingress.selfSigned` to `true`.

### Default config maps and secrets

The chart has hardcoded names for some ConfigMaps and Secrets like `argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm`, `argocd-repo-server-tls` or `argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm`. Argo CD will search for those specific names when the chart installed, so installing the chart twice in the same namespaces is not possible due to this restriction.
For more information about each configmap or secret check the references at the corresponding YAML files.

### Using SSO

In order to use SSO you need to enable Dex by setting `dex.enabled=true`. You can follow [this guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/#1-register-the-application-in-the-identity-provider) to configure your Argo CD deployment into your identity provider. After that, you need to configure Argo CD like described [here](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/#2-configure-argo-cd-for-sso). You can set the Dex configuration at `server.config.dex\.config` that will populate the `argocd-cm` config map.

> NOTE: `dex.config` is the key of the object. IF you are using the Helm CLI to set the parameter you need to scape the `.` like `--set server.config.dex\.config`.
> IMPORTANT: if you enable Dex without configuring it you will get an error similar to `msg="dex is not configured"`, and the Dex pod will never reach the running state.

### Installing a Config Management Plugin

In order to install a Config Management Plugin as described in the official [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/config-management-plugins/), it's recommended to run a sidecar container & mount the plugin configuration from a ConfigMap. You can achieve so by using `repoServer.extraVolumes`, `repoServer.sidecars` and `extraDeploy` parameters as shown in the example below:

```yaml
repoServer:
  extraVolumes:
    - name: plugin-config
      configMap:
        name: my-plugin-config
    - name: plugins
      emptyDir: {}
    - name: plugin-tmp
      emptyDir: {}
    - name: var-files
      emptyDir: {}
  sidecars:
    - name: plugin-sidecar
      command: [argocd-cmp-server, --config-dir-path, /app/config]
      image: "{{ include \"argocd.image\" . }}"
      env:
        - name: ARGOCD_PLUGINSOCKFILEPATH
          value: /app/plugins
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1001
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /app/plugins
          name: plugins
        - mountPath: /tmp
          name: plugin-tmp
        - mountPath: /var/run/argocd
          name: var-files
        # Insert plugin configuration
        - mountPath: /app/config/plugin.yaml
          subPath: plugin.yaml
          name: plugin-config
extraDeploy:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: my-plugin-config
  data:
    plugin.yaml: |
      apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
      kind: ConfigManagementPlugin
      metadata:
        name: my-plugin
      spec:
        version: v1.0
        (...)
```

### Allowing multi namespace tendancy

In case you would like to allow applications / application sets in multiple namespaces, you can use the following to configure Argo-CD.

Upstream docs:

- [Reconfigure Argo CD to allow certain namespaces for apps](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/app-any-namespace/#reconfigure-argo-cd-to-allow-certain-namespaces)
- [Reconfigure Argo CD to allow certain namespaces for appset](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Appset-Any-Namespace/#change-workload-startup-parameters)

```yaml
controller:
  # Default is true
  clusterAdminAccess: true
  extraArgs:
  # Refer to documentation to allow specific namespaces:
  # https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/app-any-namespace/#change-workload-startup-parameters
  - --application-namespaces=*
  # Refer to documentation if you are enabling notifications
  # https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/notifications/#namespace-based-configuration
  - --self-service-notification-enabled

server:
  # Default is true
  clusterAdminAccess: true
  # Refer to recommended documentation for config:
  # https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/app-any-namespace/#switch-resource-tracking-method
  config:
    application.resourceTrackingMethod: annotation

repoServer:
  # Default is false
  clusterAdminAccess: true

notifications:
  # Enable if you would like notifications to be used, default false
  enabled: true
  # Default is false
  clusterAdminAccess: true

applicationSet:
  # Enable if you would like applicationSets to be used, default false
  enabled: true
  # Default is false
  clusterAdminAccess: true

  # Refer to documentation for SCM providers:
  # https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Appset-Any-Namespace/#scm-providers-secrets-consideration
  extraEnv:
  - name: ARGOCD_APPLICATIONSET_CONTROLLER_ENABLE_SCM_PROVIDERS
    value: true
  - name: ARGOCD_APPLICATIONSET_CONTROLLER_ALLOWED_SCM_PROVIDERS
    value: https://git.mydomain.com/,https://gitlab.mydomain.com/

  # Refer to documentation to allow specific namespaces:
  # https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Appset-Any-Namespace/#change-workload-startup-parameters
  extraArgs:
  - --applicationset-namespaces=*
```

### Additional environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
argo-cd:
  extraEnvVars:
    - name: LOG_LEVEL
      value: error
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Sidecars

If additional containers are needed in the same pod as Argo-CD (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the `sidecars` parameter.

```yaml
sidecars:
- name: your-image-name
  image: your-image
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
  - name: portname
    containerPort: 1234
```

If these sidecars export extra ports, extra port definitions can be added using the `service.extraPorts` parameter (where available), as shown in the example below:

```yaml
service:
  extraPorts:
  - name: extraPort
    port: 11311
    targetPort: 11311
```

> NOTE: This Helm chart already includes sidecar containers for the Prometheus exporters (where applicable). These can be activated by adding the `--enable-metrics=true` parameter at deployment time. The `sidecars` parameter should therefore only be used for any extra sidecar containers.

If additional init containers are needed in the same pod, they can be defined using the `initContainers` parameter. Here is an example:

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

Learn more about [sidecar containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) and [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/).

### Pod affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, use one of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

The above parameters map to the env variables defined in [bitnami/argo-cd](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/argo-cd). For more information please refer to the [bitnami/argo-cd](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/argo-cd) image documentation.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set controller.replicaCount=2 \
  --set server.metrics.enabled=true \
    oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/argo-cd
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.

The above command sets the argo-cd controller replicas to 2, and enabled argo-cd server metrics.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://REGISTRY_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/argo-cd
```

> Note: You need to substitute the placeholders `REGISTRY_NAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with a reference to your Helm chart registry and repository. For example, in the case of Bitnami, you need to use `REGISTRY_NAME=registry-1.docker.io` and `REPOSITORY_NAME=bitnamicharts`.
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/argo-cd/values.yaml)

## Upgrading

### To 8.0.0

This major updates the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 21.0.0, which updates Redis&reg; from 7.4 to 8.0. [Here](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/upgrade/cluster/) you can find more information about the changes introduced in that version. No major issues are expected during the upgrade.

### To 7.1.0

This version introduces image verification for security purposes. To disable it, set `global.security.allowInsecureImages` to `true`. More details at [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/30850).

### To 7.0.0

This major updates the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 20.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#to-2000) you can find more information about the changes introduced in that version.

### To 6.0.0

This major bump changes the following security defaults:

- `runAsGroup` is changed from `0` to `1001`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is set to `true`
- `resourcesPreset` is changed from `none` to the minimum size working in our test suites (NOTE: `resourcesPreset` is not meant for production usage, but `resources` adapted to your use case).
- `global.compatibility.openshift.adaptSecurityContext` is changed from `disabled` to `auto`.

This could potentially break any customization or init scripts used in your deployment. If this is the case, change the default values to the previous ones.

### To 5.0.0

This major updates the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 18.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#to-1800) you can find more information about the changes introduced in that version.

NOTE: Due to an error in our release process, Redis&reg;' chart versions higher or equal than 17.15.4 already use Redis&reg; 7.2 by default.

### To 4.0.0

This major update the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 17.0.0, which updates Redis&reg; from its version 6.2 to the latest 7.0.

### To 3.0.0

This major update the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 16.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#to-1600) you can find more info about the specific changes.

Additionally, this chart has been standardised adding features from other charts.

### To 2.0.0

This major update the Redis&reg; subchart to its newest major, 15.0.0. [Here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#to-1500) you can find more info about the specific changes.

### To 1.0.0

In this version, the `image` block is defined once and is used in the different templates, while in the previous version, the `image` block was duplicated for every component

```yaml
image:
  registry: docker.io
  repository: bitnami/argo-cd
  tag: 2.0.5
```

VS

```yaml
controller:
  image:
    registry: docker.io
    repository: bitnami/argo-cd
    tag: 2.0.5
...
server:
  image:
    registry: docker.io
    repository: bitnami/argo-cd
    tag: 2.0.5
...
repoServer:
  image:
    registry: docker.io
    repository: bitnami/argo-cd
    tag: 2.0.5
```
